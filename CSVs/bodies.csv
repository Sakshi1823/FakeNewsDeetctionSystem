Votes are due to be counted on June 4 and results expected the same day.\n\nModi, 73, is widely tipped to win a record-equalling third term on the back of his 10-year record, which includes strong economic growth, infrastructure projects, welfare handouts and aggressive Hindu nationalism.\n\nSurveys, however, suggest unemployment, inflation and rural distress remain issues of concern in the world\'s most populous country despite its strong economy, and addressing these will be Modi\'s biggest challenge.\n\n""Our focus is on dignity of life ... on quality of life, our focus is also on creating jobs through investment,"" Modi said after releasing the manifesto, titled Modi\'s Guarantee, at the party headquarters in the capital.\n\nModi said the manifesto is focused on creating jobs in sectors such as infrastructure, aviation, railways, electric vehicles, green energy, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, among others, in a bid to address discontent at unemployment levels that are rising despite strong economic growth.\n\n""India\'s youth will not have even imagined the number of opportunities that will come their way,"" he told cheering BJP members, including top federal ministers who sat in the audience wearing stoles featuring the BJP\'s lotus symbol.\n\nCONGRESS CLAIMS EMPTY PROMISES\n\nCongress, the main opposition party, which has been struggling to revive its fortunes, said it was not impressed by a manifesto that is filled with ""empty promises"".\n\n""Today, people want to ask what happened in the last 10 years,"" Congress lawmaker Manish Tewari said. ""Unemployment is rampant and inflation has broken the back of common people. The people of the country will hold him (Modi) to account for what\'s happened in the last 10 years.""\n\nModi also vowed to expand welfare programmes, including bringing all Indians above the age of 70 under an existing free health insurance programme and pushing piped cooking gas connections to all houses to follow up on a subsidised cooking gas cylinder programme launched in 2016.\n\nOther BJP promises include raising the cap on loans for non-farming small and micro borrowers, offering free housing for another 30 million poor and keeping up a free grains programme for 800 million Indians until 2029.\n\nThe manifesto said the BJP government would continue to focus on a path of low inflation and fiscal prudence to achieve high economic growth.\n\n""The ambition of the 1.4 billion people of the country is Modi\'s mission,"" Modi said. ""I am placing this manifesto before the people to seek their blessings. Please bless us ... to increase our strength ... implement this manifesto and ensure a developed India.""\n\nUnemployment was the primary concern of 27% of the 10,000 voters surveyed by Lokniti-CSDS across 19 of India\'s 28 states, with rising prices coming second at 23%, the Hindu newspaper reported last week.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 5.4% in 2022/23, from 4.9% in 2013/14 just before Modi swept to power, and nearly 16% of urban youth in the 15-29 years age group remained unemployed in 2022/23 due to poor skills and a lack of quality jobs, official data shows.\n\n""BJP does not even want to discuss the most important issues related to people\'s lives,"" Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X. ""This time the youth is not going to fall into Modi\'s trap, now they will strengthen the hands of Congress and bring an \'employment revolution\' in the country.""

1,1,"b'NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Animated videos shared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s party targeting opposition Congress and the Muslim community have evoked complaints and outrage, as the political climate in India heats up midway through its six-week long election.\n\nThe videos, shared by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party on social media platforms Instagram and X over the last ten days, depict the Congress giving disproportionate benefits to India\'s minority Muslim community, at the cost of certain disadvantaged tribal and Hindu caste groups.\n\nThe Congress, in a complaint to the poll watchdog Election Commission, said on Sunday that the video has been shared ""clearly with an intention to wantonly provocate rioting and promote enmity between different religions"".\n\nA set of guidelines mutually adopted by political parties for how they should conduct themselves during the election period prohibit them from creating ""mutual hatred"" between caste, religious or linguistic groups.\n\nManipulated videos on social media have also become a contentious issue in this election, such as fake videos showing top Bollywood stars criticizing the prime minister.\n\nOn Monday, the commission warned parties against the misuse of AI tools to create deep fakes and told them not to publish and circulate such videos. It also said parties had been directed to remove such content within three hours of it being brought to their notice.\n\nModi, the face of the Hindu-nationalist BJP, seeking a rare third consecutive term, had focused his campaign largely on his government\'s performance on economic growth and welfare benefits.\n\nBut he changed tack after the first phase of voting on April 19 and his campaign speeches have since become more polarising on religious lines, accusing Congress of planning to redistribute the wealth of the majority Hindus among minority Muslims, who he called ""infiltrators"" who have ""more children"".\n\nThe videos shared by the BJP over the last ten days, one of which has since been taken down, illustrated the same message.\n\nA 17-second video shared by a state unit of BJP on May 4, with over 8.5 million views, shows a character resembling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi feeding ""funds"" to a bird in a skullcap, which eventually pushes out from their common nest three other birds representing other disadvantaged groups.\n\nThe Congress has filed a police complaint against BJP leaders for the video, BJP\'s head of information and technology Amit Malviya said on X.\n\n""The Congress should in fact thank the BJP for taking their manifesto to the people in a manner that even they couldn\'t,"" he wrote.\n\nThe video has elicited outrage. Nitasha Kaul, a politics professor at London\'s Westminster University said on X that the video was a ""straightforward 1930s Germany style cartoon"".\n\nIn its manifesto for the elections, the Congress has promised to tackle India\'s economic inequality by conducting a socio-economic caste census and extending affirmative action. It said it will ensure that minorities receive ""their fair share"" of education, economic and healthcare opportunities.\n\nAn Election Commission spokesperson, the BJP\'s Malviya and Congress spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik, additional reporting by Shivangi Acharya and Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Toby Chopra)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In January 2023, Jani uploaded a brunch podcast with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi during the Rajasthan leg of his Bharat Jodo Yatra that had gained a lot of traction at the time. Today, it\'s become common for top influencers to interview political leaders of regional as well as national parties.\n\nThe monetary rewards for this kind of collaboration aren\'t much, said agency heads.\n\n""Some creators have been offered cash via third-party agencies facilitating podcasts for less-prominent political leaders. But most creators are doing this for access and recognition in the political corridors. Money is incidental for them,"" said Talha Rashid, a Delhi-based political consultant and researcher.\n\nLeading finance-focused creators, or \'finfluencers,\' are being offered Rs 10-12 lakh to promote the schemes proposed by various political parties, typically through multiple videos released over a few days or weeks, one of them told ET on condition of anonymity. Such creators tend to make about 25% more on regular brand collaborations, depending on their stature, but in terms of eyeballs, it\'s a lucrative proposition.\n\n""Top influencers in areas like travel and tech are being offered money to indirectly promote cultural and digital offerings of a particular party, without disclosing that the video is a paid promotion,"" the finfluencer said.\n\nBut ""a tech influencer with the same views on a video is likely to earn four times what one can earn on a video on political content,"" said Akash Banerjee, known for his YouTube channel on political and social satire, called The Deshbhakt. ""Typically, most ads are served on tech content, then entertainment, education, and so on. Politics is way down the pecking order.""\n\nImportantly, though, brands are now willing to purchase ad inventory associated with political content online, a practice they have traditionally been known to avoid.\n\n""A decade ago, brands did not want to associate with political or religious conversations,"" said Rashid. ""We\'re now seeing a trend where brands are getting less hesitant to associate with political narratives.""\n\nWhile there\'s still reluctance to collaborate with creators who only make political content, brands are flexible to, say, sponsor a tech or travel creator who is indirectly shaping a political narrative.\n\nInstead of a blanket ban on being seen alongside political content, brands are now said to be evaluating it on the PINI scale -- \'positive influence, negative influence\' -- said the head of an influencer analytics firm. ""Anything that aligns with a nation-building narrative, for instance, is labelled as patriotic and safe to associate with,"" this person said.\n\nTo critique or not?\n\nSome creators said they turned down political collaboration offers. ""They want you to avoid criticism, but also insist on constant promotional posts, even if they\'re not relevant to your audience or don\'t align with your content focus,"" said the finfluencer cited above.\n\nCreators tackling critical political topics often struggle to monetise their content.\n\n""Only a few top creators producing critical political content get sponsors and those are also limited in number,"" said \'The Deshbhakt\' Banerjee. ""Brands in categories like audio streaming or VPN recognise that our content appeals to discerning individuals that are likely to purchase their products.""\n\nThe Deshbhakt YouTube channel boasts over 4.2 million subscribers. Banerjee said brands usually ask creators like him to be softer in their criticism for videos they are sponsoring, often asking him not to name important politicians.\n\nAdditionally, ads served on political content are far fewer and cheaper due to supply-demand of ad inventory. Google allows advertisers to block their ads from appearing on sensitive content categories, including a specific exclusion for content related to politics or news.\n\nThe cost per thousand impressions varies across countries. India tends to have significantly lower digital ad rates, compared with mature digital markets like the US.\n\nBanerjee said creators putting out content critical of political parties and their actions also tend to face \'demonetisation\' issues (where the platform does not allow the content to generate ad revenue), which limits their earnings. ""Two years ago, 21 of my videos were demonetised in a row,"" he recalled.\n\nThere have been instances of newsfluencers receiving notifications from YouTube about their videos, especially those related to electronic voting machines, being demonetised.\n\n""Creators who wish to monetise their content with ads must abide by our advertiser-friendly content guidelines,"" a YouTube spokesperson told ET by email. ""These policies are global and are designed to help maintain our brand safety and suitability standards. We apply them consistently to all creators, regardless of their political viewpoint, position or affiliation.""\n\nSelling online courses and member-only subscription plans are alternatives but unsustainable avenues of earning income for creators who continue to make critical content on political parties.\n\nHowever, Banerjee said that though there will be many more creators of political content over the next few weeks, it\'s likely to peter out after the election verdict, at which point creators may struggle to retain their audience.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The challenge for JDU this time is to repeat the victory of 2019 while managing the anger of BJP cadre which still thinks that the seat should have gone to BJP. There are six assembly constituencies in Bhagalpur, of which BJP won three while JDU, Congress and RJD won one each. A section of BJP workers still recall the days when BJP used to field senior party leaders from here.\n\nIn 2014, RJD\'s Shailesh Kumar, alias Bulo Mandal, defeated BJP\'s Shahnawaz Hussain. Hussain won the seat in 2009 and before that BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi won it in 2004.\n\nFrom the INDIA bloc, the seat has gone to Congress and it has fielded Bhagalpur MLA Ajeet Sharma. Congress is putting in all efforts to win this seat which the party last won in 1984. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav did a joint rally in Bhagalpur which has raised the political temperature here.\n\nJDU is aware of the challenge and the party has deployed state minister Sunil Kumar to look after the constituency.

""First, we will conduct a caste census to know the exact population and status of backward castes, SCs, STs, minorities and other castes.

""This urban-naxal mindset, my mothers and sisters, they will not even leave your \'mangalsutra\'. They can go to that level,"" Modi said addressing a rally in Rajasthan\'s Banswara.\n\nUS-based Congress leader Sam Pitroda fuelled the controversy by proposing inheritance tax as a way to redistribute wealth. """"In America, there is an inheritance tax. If one has $100 million worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer probably 45% to his children, 55% is grabbed by the government. That\'s an interesting law,"" he said. He later said he was just giving an example. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that Pitroda\'s comments do not reflect the party\'s position.\n\nIn an interview to TOI yesterday, Modi analysed the Congress\' controversial idea in detail, calling it a ""Maoist"" idea. ""We should not consider this sinister plan of the Congress party like an idle threat. The threat is very real and stands to hurt our nation irreversibly.

They will raid the common man to see how much wealth he/she has earned through hard work. They will raid the ornaments of our women. Our Constitution protects the property of all minorities.

This will sow complete and irreversible communal disharmony,"" he said.\n\nRead the full interview: \'India does not become an electoral autocracy if Yuvraj cannot get power\': PM Modi\n\nPM Modi said ideas of wealth redistribution, wealth tax, etc, are never successful because they never remove poverty, but just distribute it so that everyone is equally poor. ""These are actually dangerous problems disguised as solutions.

There are concerns about the possibility of a non-Odia assuming leadership in Odisha, raising questions about Odia identity and self-respect in a state founded on linguistic principles.\n\nWithin the BJD, Pandian is listed among the top 40 star campaigners, positioned prominently alongside party candidates in all campaign activities, often sharing the stage with Naveen himself.\n\nFrom IAS officer to BJD strategist\n\nPandian\'s journey began in 2011 when he joined the CM\'s office as Naveen\'s private secretary, impressing the CM with his efficiency. He quickly rose to become a key figure in devising electoral strategies for the BJD in the 2014 and 2019 elections.\n\nBefore VK Pandian\'s retirement from his role as the CM\'s secretary in October last year, BJP and Congress leaders had been questioning the extent of his influence and the perceived extra-constitutional authority he wielded. However, his subsequent decision to voluntarily retire and join the BJD shifted the focus to the label of ""outsider"" in discussions surrounding his entry into the party.\n\nPandian remains calm and composed despite the scrutiny.\n\n""I am an Indian by birth and Odia by breath. The mother tongue of my children is Odia and Odisha is my karmabhoomi (land where one works),"" he said.\n\nRegarding the prospect of succeeding Naveen, Pandian expressed that he sees himself inheriting Naveen\'s values of integrity, dedication to the people of Odisha, and hard work. He emphasised that Naveen has always maintained that the people of Odisha will determine his successor.\n\nPandian, who belongs to the 2000-batch of IAS officers, was initially assigned to the Punjab cadre. However, shortly after his marriage to Sujata Rout (now Sujata R Karthikeyan), also an IAS officer of the 2000-batch from Odisha, he requested a transfer to the Odisha cadre. Sujata hails from a village in Kendrapada district, Odisha. Recently, she was transferred to a non-election related and non-public facing position in the state finance department following an Election Commission directive, citing alleged violations of the poll code.\n\nMuch like his mentor Naveen, who often appears in loose-fitting white kurta-pyjama and slippers during public appearances, Pandian maintains a consistent attire of untucked full-sleeve white shirts and predominantly grey trousers at all his meetings.\n\nDuring the alliance negotiations between BJP and BJD in March, Pandian played a pivotal role as the main negotiator for BJD, frequently traveling to Delhi for discussions.\n\nReflecting on Pandian\'s ascent, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, representing BJP in Odisha, expressed concerns over the erosion of established democratic processes under Naveen\'s leadership. He criticized what he perceived as the sidelining of the electoral mandate in favor of an unelected official, highlighting broader concerns about democratic principles and Odisha\'s dignity.\n\nCapitalising on the sentiment of ""Odia asmita,"" BJP aims to secure its first government in Odisha and expand its Lok Sabha seat count beyond the 8 seats obtained in 2019. In the previous election, BJD secured 12 LS seats, while Congress managed one. In the assembly polls, BJD dominated with 113 seats, followed by BJP with 23, Congress with 9, and others with 2.\n\nAddressing allegations of being an outsider, Pandian challenged BJP\'s right to speak on Odia \'asmita,\' citing instances such as the Bharat Ratna awarded to Biju Patnaik, a non-Odia, while the historic Paika revolt of 1817 from Odisha received inadequate recognition from the BJP government.\n\nThere is speculation that Naveen, who is contesting from two assembly seats -- Hinjili and Kantabanji -- may vacate one to accommodate Pandian.\n\nAnalysts\' perspectives\n\nPolitical analysts view Naveen\'s decision to elevate Pandian from a backroom role to a prominent campaigner as a calculated risk in his bid for a sixth term at the age of 77.\n\n""If BJD does well, Pandian will get legitimacy and grow in stature. If it falters, the blame will fall on him because Naveen has never lost elections since he became CM for the first time in 2000,"" Surya Nayaran Mishra, a retired professor of political science from Utkal University told TOI.\n\n""It\'s a test case for electoral politics in Odisha as nothing similar has happened in the past,"" said RK Satapathy, another retired professor of political science at North-Eastern Hill University. ""If BJD does well, Naveen will make history by becoming the longest-serving CM within a few months. Pandian\'s acceptability will also increase. For a large section of voters, content with freebies, who is at the helm doesn\'t matter much. But I doubt if politically conscious people will accept him,"" he said.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

99,99,"b'VK Pandian, a former IAS officer hailing from Tamil Nadu, has emerged as a central figure within the BJD party. His rapid ascent and perceived alignment with CM Naveen Patnaik have drawn both attention and criticism from opposition leaders, sparking debates about Odia identity and leadership in the state. As Pandian assumes a key role in the party\'s campaign machinery, his influence and potential succession to Naveen\'s legacy are under intense scrutiny.The Odisha election landscape is now dominated by VK Pandian, a former IAS officer from Tamil Nadu who resigned from the service to join the BJD. Pandian, widely regarded as the potential political heir to CM Naveen Patnaik, has assumed a pivotal role as the party\'s chief campaigner and strategist.\n\nHis sudden prominence has made him the primary target of opposition leaders, including PM Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP President JP Nadda, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. There are concerns about the possibility of a non-Odia assuming leadership in Odisha, raising questions about Odia identity and self-respect in a state founded on linguistic principles.\n\nWithin the BJD, Pandian is listed among the top 40 star campaigners, positioned prominently alongside party candidates in all campaign activities, often sharing the stage with Naveen himself.\n\nFrom IAS officer to BJD strategist\n\nPandian\'s journey began in 2011 when he joined the CM\'s office as Naveen\'s private secretary, impressing the CM with his efficiency. He quickly rose to become a key figure in devising electoral strategies for the BJD in the 2014 and 2019 elections.\n\nBefore VK Pandian\'s retirement from his role as the CM\'s secretary in October last year, BJP and Congress leaders had been questioning the extent of his influence and the perceived extra-constitutional authority he wielded. However, his subsequent decision to voluntarily retire and join the BJD shifted the focus to the label of ""outsider"" in discussions surrounding his entry into the party.\n\nPandian remains calm and composed despite the scrutiny.\n\n""I am an Indian by birth and Odia by breath. The mother tongue of my children is Odia and Odisha is my karmabhoomi (land where one works),"" he said.\n\nRegarding the prospect of succeeding Naveen, Pandian expressed that he sees himself inheriting Naveen\'s values of integrity, dedication to the people of Odisha, and hard work. He emphasised that Naveen has always maintained that the people of Odisha will determine his successor.\n\nPandian, who belongs to the 2000-batch of IAS officers, was initially assigned to the Punjab cadre. However, shortly after his marriage to Sujata Rout (now Sujata R Karthikeyan), also an IAS officer of the 2000-batch from Odisha, he requested a transfer to the Odisha cadre. Sujata hails from a village in Kendrapada district, Odisha. Recently, she was transferred to a non-election related and non-public facing position in the state finance department following an Election Commission directive, citing alleged violations of the poll code.\n\nMuch like his mentor Naveen, who often appears in loose-fitting white kurta-pyjama and slippers during public appearances, Pandian maintains a consistent attire of untucked full-sleeve white shirts and predominantly grey trousers at all his meetings.\n\nDuring the alliance negotiations between BJP and BJD in March, Pandian played a pivotal role as the main negotiator for BJD, frequently traveling to Delhi for discussions.\n\nReflecting on Pandian\'s ascent, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, representing BJP in Odisha, expressed concerns over the erosion of established democratic processes under Naveen\'s leadership. He criticized what he perceived as the sidelining of the electoral mandate in favor of an unelected official, highlighting broader concerns about democratic principles and Odisha\'s dignity.\n\nCapitalising on the sentiment of ""Odia asmita,"" BJP aims to secure its first government in Odisha and expand its Lok Sabha seat count beyond the 8 seats obtained in 2019. In the previous election, BJD secured 12 LS seats, while Congress managed one. In the assembly polls, BJD dominated with 113 seats, followed by BJP with 23, Congress with 9, and others with 2.\n\nAddressing allegations of being an outsider, Pandian challenged BJP\'s right to speak on Odia \'asmita,\' citing instances such as the Bharat Ratna awarded to Biju Patnaik, a non-Odia, while the historic Paika revolt of 1817 from Odisha received inadequate recognition from the BJP government.\n\nThere is speculation that Naveen, who is contesting from two assembly seats -- Hinjili and Kantabanji -- may vacate one to accommodate Pandian.\n\nAnalysts\' perspectives\n\nPolitical analysts view Naveen\'s decision to elevate Pandian from a backroom role to a prominent campaigner as a calculated risk in his bid for a sixth term at the age of 77.\n\n""If BJD does well, Pandian will get legitimacy and grow in stature. If it falters, the blame will fall on him because Naveen has never lost elections since he became CM for the first time in 2000,"" Surya Nayaran Mishra, a retired professor of political science from Utkal University told TOI.\n\n""It\'s a test case for electoral politics in Odisha as nothing similar has happened in the past,"" said RK Satapathy, another retired professor of political science at North-Eastern Hill University. ""If BJD does well, Naveen will make history by becoming the longest-serving CM within a few months. Pandian\'s acceptability will also increase. For a large section of voters, content with freebies, who is at the helm doesn\'t matter much. But I doubt if politically conscious people will accept him,"" he said.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Reserve Bank of India may continue to prevent any sharp swings in the currency by absorbing inflows, he said.\n\nIndia\'s bond market is likely to see additional inflows of as much as $30 billion after the nation\'s inclusion in JPMorgan Chase & Co.\'s emerging market index starting in June. The flows will test the RBI\'s tight grip on the rupee that helped limit volatility in the currency and aided the nation\'s export competitiveness.\n\nEven though the currency touched a record low of 83.58 against the dollar in April, it has outperformed emerging Asia peers this year, boosting its appeal for investors.\n\nWhat India\'s Addition to JPMorgan\'s Bond Index Means: QuickTake\n\n""India does seem pretty well poised with bond index inclusion and flows that should be coming in the second half of the year,"" said Zook, who has worked at the US Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund in the past. ""The RBI has large external reserve buffers and a modest current-account deficit at this point in time.""\n\nFitch\'s estimate for the rupee is stronger than the median estimate of 83 per dollar in a Bloomberg survey. A shrinking trade deficit and limited impact on crude oil prices from the conflict in the Middle East are in favor of the currency.\n\nTo shield the nation from hot money flows, the RBI has built one of the largest stockpiles of foreign exchange in the world. A widely anticipated win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the ongoing national polls is also bolstering the case for inflows.\n\n""Even if there is an oil price shock, India has the buffers to manage some of those risks,"" said Zook.

The survey is a vote of confidence in India Inc. as the world\'s largest democracy is headed to general elections carried out over seven phases from April 19 until June 1.\n\n""There are many reasons to prefer expensive India equities over cheap China ones such as better transmission of GDP growth into earnings growth,"" said Kieran Calder, head of equity research for Asia at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. A ""better track record of delivering consistent earnings growth and supportive geopolitical environment"" further bolster the case for Indian shares, he said.Key stock indexes in both India and Japan have climbed to records this year following a rally driven by rapid economic growth in the case of India, and the gradual return of inflation, along with corporate reforms in Japan. Indian equities now trade at around 23 times next year\'s expected earnings, exceeding even the US, and outpacing the 17 for Japan and about nine for China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on MSCI Inc.\'s indexes.\n\nThe main gauge of Chinese equities has tumbled about 40% from its peak set three years ago as deflation and a rolling property crisis have weighed on the economy. More than half of the survey respondents said they expected China\'s equity market to underperform India and Japan\'s over the next 12 months.\n\nIndian equities attracted $25 billion in net inflows for the year through March, compared with just $5.3 billion for China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The tailwinds behind Indian shares include the growing population and optimism the growing middle class will feed into higher corporate profits.\n\n""India is the best market to own,"" said Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager at M&G Investments in Singapore. Indian equities are likely to play a large role in regional benchmarks, he said.\n\nIndian shares now make up 18% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. China\'s 25% weighting is well down from its high of more than 40% a few years ago.\n\nInfrastructure in India was highlighted as a particular bright spot in the survey by 41% of the respondents. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has more than tripled its infrastructure allocation from five years ago to more than 11 trillion rupees ($132 billion) for the 2025 fiscal year. Modi is projected to invest 143 trillion rupees to modernize critical infrastructure in the six years through 2030.\n\nIndia\'s infrastructure and capital goods bellwether Larsen & Toubro Ltd. is trading at a price-earnings ratio of about 30 times. At the same time, other firms such as PNC Infratech Ltd. and JSW Infrastructure Ltd. are still trading at or below their 10-year average valuations.\n\nThe South Asian nation has also fast emerged as an alternative to China for global manufacturing, with the likes of Apple Inc. beefing up its production facilities in the country.\n\nModi\'s party faces a national election this year, and he has made India\'s accelerating economy a major part of his pitch. He is expected to return as prime minister with a strong majority to deepen infrastructure investment and manufacturing. Should he lose, it may derail the infrastructure and manufacturing push. Investors don\'t seem concerned though, with more than four-fifths of respondents saying the impact of the elections on markets would be negligible or doesn\'t concern them.\n\nJapanese value stocks, typically larger and well established firms that trade at relatively cheap metrics, were also identified by more than a third of respondents as an attractive investment.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the rally in Japanese equities has been the corporate reforms pursued by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\n""Japanese companies are dealing with the TSE\'s request seriously,"" said Fumie Kikuchi, a research analyst at GMO in Singapore. ""It means a lot that now corporate management speaks the same language that investors do.""\n\nIn China, meanwhile, slowing economic growth, the specter of deflation and the ongoing real-estate crisis are likely to deter investors, according to Adrian Zuercher, head of global asset allocation and co-head for global investment management APAC at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\n""There\'s very little incentive to allocate to China,"" he said.

Tesla\'s price cuts have squeezed its profit margins and caused its stock to fall about 4% in trading Monday, ahead of its first quarter earnings report due out after the bell Tuesday.\n\nOn Sunday, the EV giant slashed the starting prices of four models sold in mainland China, its largest overseas market, by 14,000 yuan ($1,932).

In contrast, Tesla\'s Model 3, its cheapest model, currently costs three times more at 231,900 yuan ($32,017) in China following Sunday\'s price cut.\n\nChina\'s EV price war started in October 2022, when Tesla cut prices to boost sales as consumers slashed spending in a slowing economy. Almost all major manufacturers, including makers of gasoline vehicles, followed suit, impacting the entire auto industry\'s profit margins.\n\nThe competition continues unabated in 2024, with more than 30 major car makers announcing further price cuts.\n\nOn Friday, XPeng, the Guangzhou-based EV maker, said it would offer 500 million yuan ($69 million) worth of subsidies for buyers who snap up four of its models.\n\nIn March, BYD lowered the starting price of its most affordable EV, the Seagull hatchback, by 5% to 69,800 yuan ($9,670).

110,110,"b'BEIJING/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Tesla has cut prices in a number of its major markets - including in China and Germany - after price cuts in the United States - as it grapples with falling sales and an intensifying price war for electric vehicles (EVs), especially against cheaper Chinese EVs.\n\nThe swathe of price cuts comes after Elon Musk\'s EV maker reported this month that its global vehicle deliveries in the first quarter fell for the first time in nearly four years.\n\nTesla cut the starting price of the revamped Model 3 in China by 14,000 yuan ($1,930) to 231,900 yuan ($32,000), its official website showed on Sunday.\n\nIn Germany, the carmaker trimmed the price of its Model 3 rear wheel drive to 40,990 euros ($43,670.75) from 42,990 euros, where the price has been since February.\n\nThere were also price cuts in many other countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, a Tesla spokesperson said.\n\nThe carmaker cut U.S. prices of its Model Y, Model X and Model S vehicles by $2,000 on Friday. On Saturday it slashed the price of its Full Self-Driving driver assistant software to $8,000 from $12,000 in the United States.\n\nThe EV maker has been slow to refresh its ageing models as high interest rates have sapped consumer appetite for big-ticket items, while rivals in China, the world\'s largest auto market, are rolling out cheaper models.\n\nThis weekend, Musk postponed a planned trip to India, where he was to have met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing obligations at Tesla.

111,111,"b'(Bloomberg) -- Built along a stretch of salt flats in southern India, the Tuticorin power plant epitomizes a quagmire for the world\'s fastest-growing major economy: how to provide reliable energy to 1.4 billion people.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFor starters, the 1,050-megawatt coal plant, one of the region\'s largest, was supposed to shut down. Opened four decades ago, the facility is too cramped to install retrofits to meet the government\'s pollution norms, prompting India\'s power ministry to plan its closure by 2022. Yet the facility continues to run at full blast, clocking 90% utilization in February. Aging boilers guzzle coal from mines nearly 2,000 kilometers away -- a transport distance that only adds to the nation\'s emissions footprint.\n\nElectricity consumption in India is growing at the fastest rate of any major economy, driven by rising temperatures and incomes, which have pushed up sales of power-intensive appliances like air conditioners. That explosive equation has exposed the country\'s teetering grid. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to rapidly build out solar and wind generation to replace polluting fossil fuels, his administration hasn\'t been able to keep up with demand, giving a second life to old, inefficient coal plants like the one in Tuticorin.\n\nIn recent months, Modi has green-lit a fresh wave of power station development and extended the lifespan of many existing coal assets. It\'s a decision that puts India at odds with global allies who\'re shunning the fuel on climate grounds, threatening Modi\'s ambitions to curb air pollution and reduce the world\'s third-largest share of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThose dynamics will also hand the nation a crucial role in dictating the speed of the world\'s retreat from coal. Demand in China, currently the top consumer, probably peaked last year and the rate of future growth will increasingly be driven by India and Southeast Asia\'s rising economies, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\n""The message is clear to both the international and domestic audiences: We\'re all in for climate actions, but India\'s domestic interests will take priority,"" said Ashwini K. Swain, a fellow at Sustainable Futures Collaborative, a climate think tank in New Delhi.\n\nIndia\'s power ministry and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corp., which runs the Tuticorin coal plant, didn\'t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIndia has a long way to go to ensure reliable and affordable electricity. In Oct. 2021, the country was hit by a massive coal and power crisis, just as the economy began to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. Years of weak demand had led to sluggish growth in mining, transportation and power generation capacities.\n\nSoon after the situation improved, officials realized the crisis wasn\'t a blip. Energy demand rose to a new high the following summer, causing the worst supply shortages in eight years. In 2023, even though that squeeze eased at the national level, Maharashtra, one of India\'s most industrialized states and home to its financial capital Mumbai, faced an alarming 10% peak deficit in August.\n\nWhile shortages raised expectations that the country would accelerate the shift to green energy, India\'s response was exactly the opposite. Officials pushed for more mining, abandoned plans to retire old power plants, raised targets to add coal-fired electricity and successfully lobbied international forums to adopt resolutions that wouldn\'t hinder fossil fuel use.\n\n""As a country, we should play to our strength, and coal is our strength,"" said Prakash Tiwari, a former operations director at state-run NTPC Ltd., the nation\'s largest power producer.\n\nAlternative energy solutions haven\'t yet caught on for financial, political and safety reasons.\n\nMore than 35 miles from Tuticorin, a dusty road leads to two solar power plants surrounded by sprawling wind parks. Ayana Renewable Power, which runs one of the facilities, sees a future in renewable power with energy storage to serve industrial users. That trend is rising in India, although far from becoming a source of mass power supplies. Solar accounted for 6% of generation in 2023, according to Bloomberg calculations based on power ministry data.\n\nState-run power producer NLC India Ltd., which runs the other plant, is committing more than twice as much money to expanding mining, coal and lignite-fired power capacity than to building renewables, according to Chairman M. Prasanna Kumar.\n\nNatural gas, pushed by producers as a less-polluting alternative to coal, has also struggled to compete. Nearly 25 gigawatts of gas-fired power capacity has been idling for years, priced out by other power sources, including coal. India doesn\'t have enough domestically produced subsidized fuel to run the plants and operating these assets on imported liquefied natural gas is often too costly in India\'s price-competitive electricity market.\n\nBuilding hydropower dams is also fraught. Most of India\'s potential there is locked in the fragile Himalayan region, where frequent extreme weather events, such as flash floods, jeopardize projects. The risks have galvanized local opposition against large dams, delaying plans by years and adding to costs that have rendered many of them unpalatable.\n\nNuclear power has seen a revival in many parts of the world for its low-emissions energy. But there, too, the industry in India has moved too slowly to make a mark and questions about safety persist. The nation\'s nuclear liability law holds vendors and suppliers responsible for accidents. Many are still haunted by the Bhopal gas tragedy of 1984, which killed thousands of people exposed to toxic chemicals.\n\nConsider Kudankulam, about 90 miles south of Tuticorin. The site hosts two reactors of 1 gigawatt each and four more are being added. In the nearby village of Idinthakarai, 52-year-old Mildred, who goes by one name, has been at the forefront of protesting the plant\'s construction. She\'s traveled across the country to discuss the risks of nuclear energy.\n\n""Why can\'t these be our main source of energy?"" the activist asked on a recent day, pointing to a few rotating wind turbines near her home.\n\nIn 2008, India struck an agreement with the US to share nuclear technology and fuel, clearing the runway for new projects. India has also signed deals with foreign reactor suppliers, including General Electric-Hitachi, Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Areva SA, which later transfered the project to state-run peer Electricite de France SA. GE-Hitachi has since backed out, citing the liability law.\n\nIn the western state of Maharashtra, India had planned to build the world\'s largest nuclear power plant, a mammoth 9.6 gigawatts facility near sprawling Alphonso mango orchards.\n\nBut locals resisted selling their land when Kiran Dixit, then an executive director of the state monopoly Nuclear Power Corp. of India Ltd., visited the area.\n\nThey thought prices were too low and worried that the plan would harm the livelihood of fishermen and the mango trees. The company tried to put those fears to rest and the land was eventually acquired, Dixit said. Still, the Jaitapur project has yet to significantly break ground as the two sides continue to discuss terms of the deal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
112,112,"b'According to details of the proceedings posted on the court website on Friday, Tesla said the battery maker had continued to use the brand name despite a cease-and-desist notice sent in April 2022.\n\nIt comes amid swathes of layoffs at the US-based car manufacturer, which have impacted at least 500 employees. As recently as Monday it was announced that the Tesla team responsible for constructing electric charging stations was to be axed.\n\nTesla\'s senior director of US HR, Allie Arebalo, reportedly also left her position recently, though it was unclear whether this was part of the cuts, or a decision by Ms Arebalo herself.\n\nDuring this week\'s hearing in New Delhi, the Indian company, Tesla Power India Pvt Ltd, argued its main business is to make ""lead acid batteries"" and has no intention of making electric vehicles, Reuters reported.\n\nThe judge has allowed the Indian firm three weeks to submit written responses after it handed over a set of documents in support of its defence. Mr Musk\'s Tesla is incorporated in Delaware, and it has accused the Indian company of using trade names ""Tesla Power"" and ""Tesla Power USA"".\n\nThe case will next be heard on May 22.\n\nThe court record included screenshots of a website that showed that Tesla Power USA LLC was also headquartered in Delaware and had been ""acknowledged for being a pioneer and leader in introducing affordable batteries"" with ""a very strong presence in India"".\n\nA Tesla Power representative told Reuters it had been present in India much before Mr Musk\'s Tesla company and had all government approvals. ""We have never claimed to be related to Elon Musk\'s Tesla,"" Tesla Power\'s Manoj Pahwa said, per Reuters.\n\nTesla told the judge it discovered the Indian company was using its brand name in 2022 and had unsuccessfully tried to stop it from doing so, forcing it to file the lawsuit.\n\nMr Musk also recently cancelled his planned visit to India on April 21 to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Instead, he made a surprise visit to China, seen by many as a snub to India.\n\nIt comes after Tesla experienced a recent sales slump, with the company reporting a 55 per cent drop in profit in its first quarter. On Tuesday, Tesla stock dropped five per cent, following a previous decline of below $150 per share.\n\nEarlier this month the manufacturer was forced to discount five of their models by $5,000 earlier this month. In the same week, Tesla announced it would be eliminating 10 per cent of its workforce, which totalled about 14,000 jobs across the globe.\n\nFollowing the announcement about its electric vehicle charging station construction team, New York City rideshare and EV charging company Revel has expressed interest in the real estate.\n\nFrank Reig, the CEO and co-founder of Revel, told InsideEVs, that as the company expands its fast-charger network it is looking to potentially build at several of the sites that Tesla has stepped away from.\n\n""Tesla has left some really good sites on the table in New York,"" Mr Reig told the outlet.\n\n""They\'re power-ready, have good landlords and are in the right locations to get a lot of use, particularly from rideshare drivers. Those kinds of sites are super rare. We\'re definitely interested in filling that opening.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It ends on June 1 and votes will be counted on June 4.\n\nOn Friday, in the largest of the seven phases, 166 million voters in 102 constituencies across 21 states and territories will vote.\n\nSurveys suggest BJP will easily win a majority even though voters have serious concerns about unemployment, inflation and rural distress in the world\'s fastest growing major economy, with the spotlight being on whether BJP can improve on its 2019 victory and by how much.\n\n""In the next five years, we will take our nation into the top three economies of the world, launch a final and decisive assault against poverty, open up newer avenues of growth ... unveil the next generation of reforms, and take a number of pro-people decisions and actions,"" Modi wrote in the BJP\'s election manifesto.\n\nThe manifesto and the theme of the BJP campaign is titled ""Modi Ki Guarantee"" or Modi\'s guarantee to fulfill promises made to voters, underlining the unusual leader-centric, presidential-style pitch in a parliamentary system.\n\nIf he wins, Modi will be only the second Indian prime minister to be elected three times in a row, after post-independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nModi says that his first two terms were appetisers and the main course will be served in the third term. BJP hoardings across towns and cities highlight a range of achievements including India\'s historic landing on the moon\'s south pole and fighting corruption to woo voters.\n\nHindu nationalism is a key theme. Modi\'s government and BJP are accused by critics of discriminating against or targeting India\'s 200 million minority Muslims to please their hardline Hindu base - charges both deny. Sporadic violence between Hindus and Muslims continues to break out.\n\nOPPOSITION WEAK, FRAGMENTED\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance says the election is an ideological battle being fought to stop the BJP from ending the constitution and democratic system.\n\nRahul Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party, said the BJP always seeks to divert attention from major issues such as unemployment and price rise.\n\n""Sometimes the PM goes underwater in the ocean and sometimes he is on a seaplane but does not talk about issues,"" Gandhi said, referring to Modi\'s widely publicised engagements in recent months.\n\nWhile the alliance has struggled to forge unity and field common candidates against the BJP, it has accused the government of denying it a level playing field by arresting opposition leaders in corruption cases and making huge tax demands ahead of the vote - charges the government denies.\n\nChandrachur Singh, who teaches politics at Delhi\'s Hindu College, said the BJP has a clear edge but also faces real challenges.\n\n""It\'s not an election where there are no issues,"" he said. ""There are issues which could have led to anti-incumbency. But that is something which is not being channelised or harnessed by a fragmented, divided, weak opposition.""\n\n""That is what is causing some kind of disillusionment among voters and allowing BJP to surge ahead.""\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik in Kairana, Praveen Paramasivam in Chennai and YP Rajesh in New Delhi; Writing by YP Rajesh; Editing by Angus MacSwan)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investors are also watching how earnings in Japan get impacted by the yen\'s sharp depreciation while searching for new winners in India\'s pricey market.\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index is expected to see its first year-on-year profit growth in eight quarters, with earnings per share rising 4.1% for the period ended March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The yen has weakened to a 34-year low, putting traders on alert for intervention by Japanese authorities to defend the currency.\n\nThe weak yen has helped Japan\'s exporters rake in record profits and drive the Nikkei 225 Stock Average to an all-time high.

That\'s the biggest increase since the fourth quarter of 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThat may bode well for the gauge, which stands little changed from where it was at the end of 2022.

The figure has grown 8% since the 2019 elections.\n\nWith an estimated population of more than 1.4 billion, India overtook China last year as the world's most populous country.\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL SPREAD\n\nSome of India's 28 states and eight federally governed territories complete voting in just one phase, but in larger states, some constituencies vote on different dates.\n\nFor example, the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, with a population of more than 230 million and 80 members of parliament, more than any other state, will vote in parts in every phase.\n\nThe Election Commission manages this massive exercise by carving out smaller voting boroughs, limiting each polling station to no more than 1,500 registered voters.\n\nThat requires the watchdog to set up 1.048 million polling stations this year, in locations such as government buildings and schools that are the closest to the majority of voters.\n\nThey are sited in terrain ranging from icy Himalayan heights in the north to dense central Indian jungles and remote deserts in the western state of Rajasthan.\n\nSECURITY ARRANGEMENTS\n\nIncidents of violence and vote-rigging have marred India's election history, but there are drastically fewer instances today.\n\nNevertheless, to ensure the elections are free, fair and held without fear, more than 300,000 federal security personnel back up the police forces controlled by state governments.\n\nThe intervals between voting allows these personnel time to move around the country, usually by rail.\n\nThey guard election officials taking voting machines to polling stations and then keep the devices secure until counting day to maintain the integrity of the elections.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik; Additional reporting by Kripa Jayaram; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120,120,"b'(Bloomberg) -- KKR & Co. says the consumer sector will continue to provide investment opportunities in India, where the US buyout giant is also building out its private credit portfolio.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe investment firm remains bullish on India\'s domestic consumption story despite elevated valuations, according to Gaurav Trehan, head of Asia Private Equity and the chief executive officer of the India business.\n\n""It\'s probably one of those sectors where valuations sustain and we believe this will continue to be a 15, 20, 25, 30-year story in India,"" Trehan said in an interview in Mumbai.\n\nKKR joins a wave of global firms deploying billions of dollars in the world\'s most-populous nation, attracted by the fastest-growing major economy and investment incentives offered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Blackstone Inc. aims to add an additional $25 billion of Indian private equity assets over the next five years, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. plans to invest as much as $4 billion over the same period.\n\nKKR has deployed about $11 billion in India over almost two decades, where it has invested in companies across healthcare, life sciences, technology services and consumer-focused sectors. Its co-founder Henry Kravis said earlier this year that the firm will deploy its next $10 billion in the country at a faster clip than before, according to local media reports.\n\nIn the consumer segment, the firm has backed eyewear retail chain Lenskart Solutions Pvt and Lighthouse Learning Group, an early childhood and education group. KKR has also taken a stake in Mukesh Ambani\'s retail business.\n\nKKR could also look at companies in the manufacturing sector, where it has so far made only one bet on Alliance Tire Group in 2013, Trehan said.\n\n""Something in manufacturing maybe could be an interesting play for us over time given the fact there\'s a big impetus from the government to create India as a manufacturing hub,"" Trehan said.\n\nModi\'s government has rolled out incentive programs of some 2.7 trillion rupees ($32.3 billion) to encourage domestic manufacturing, offering companies tax breaks and lower land rates. The strategy has had success as companies look for alternatives to China, and firms like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. have ramped up production.\n\nAdvisers\n\nKKR also plans to add outside executive advisers, starting with its consumer business, Trehan said.\n\n""The advisers will help our CEOs and our management teams execute, provide the strategic vision and help them upgrade,"" he said.\n\nIt hasn\'t always been smooth sailing for the firm in India. KKR got burnt on its local credit portfolio, which lost money and saw a chunk of its capital wiped out in 2019 amid a shadow banking crisis. The unit was later merged with InCred Financial Services Ltd., a local consumer lender.\n\nThe firm continues to invest in India through its Asia credit fund, Trehan said. The company raised $1.1 billion for its debut KKR Asia Credit Opportunities Fund in 2022, to offer loans for performing credit in the Asia-Pacific region. The firm expects India to account for 20% of the direct lending market in the region.\n\n""It\'s going to be a big opportunity for us going forward,"" he said. ""We are very focused on it, on scaling that up over the next three to five years.""\n\nReal Estate\n\nKKR, which has a large infrastructure portfolio in India where it invests in roads, highways and renewables, has stayed away from real estate so far. This may change in future.\n\n""I don\'t think it\'s a sector we don\'t want to be in,"" Trehan said. ""We are just figuring out when is the right time to come in.""\n\nFounded in 1976 by Kravis, Jerome Kohlberg and George Roberts, KKR has moved beyond its private equity roots to becoming an alternative-asset management giant with strategies including buyouts, credit, infrastructure, real estate and insurance.\n\nAt its investor day this month, KKR executives said they aimed to have $1 trillion of assets under management in five years, pointing to Asia, infrastructure, retirement and wealth as key growth areas.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

124,124,"b'(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. has cut prices in China and the US, its two key markets, after disappointing first-quarter sales contributed to swelling inventory.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIn China, Tesla lowered prices across its range, with the revamped Model 3 falling to 231,900 yuan ($32,000) from 245,900 previously. The Model Y was discounted to 249,900 yuan -- or about $34,500 -- from 263,900 yuan.\n\nIn the US, the cheapest version of the Model Y is now $42,990, returning the sport utility vehicle\'s starting price to the lowest it\'s been. Tesla also discounted the two other more expensive versions of the Model Y by $2,000, and dropped the price of the Model X to its lowest yet.\n\nThe cuts cap a wild week for the Austin-based automaker, even by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk\'s standards. It started when Musk announced in a memo to the company\'s more than 140,000 employees that he was reducing headcount by more than 10% globally. Two top executives also left.\n\nRead More: Tesla Senior Executives Leave in Midst of Global Job Cuts\n\nOn Wednesday, Tesla said in its proxy statement that it will ask shareholders to vote again on a $56 billion compensation package for Musk that was voided by a Delaware court in January.\n\nAnd on Friday, the company recalled almost 3,900 Cybertruck pickups to fix or replace accelerator pedals that can dislodge and cause the vehicle to unintentionally accelerate, increasing risk of a crash.\n\nThen on Saturday, Musk postponed a planned trip to India this week, where he was expected to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he had to deal with ""heavy obligations"" at Tesla.\n\nRead More: Musk Postpones India Visit, Citing Heavy Tesla Obligations\n\nTesla reports first-quarter earnings on April 23.

Bountiful rains will not only help hundreds of millions of farmers in reaping good harvests, but also support the central bank\'s effort to cool food inflation, which was at 8.5% in March.\n\nThe administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is seeking a third five-year term in elections starting this month, has taken several steps to contain food prices. It has extended restrictions on exports of several agricultural commodities, sold grains from state reserves and cracked down on hoarding.\n\nForecast of a normal monsoon bodes well for easing food costs, and headline consumer price inflation eventually, said Anubhuti Sahay, head of economic research, South Asia, at Standard Chartered Plc. A good monsoon is likely to boost rural demand and address concerns about tepid private consumption growth, she said.\n\nThis year\'s rainfall assumes significance for the nation, which witnessed the weakest monsoon in five years in 2023. Good showers will also help winter crops such as wheat and some oilseeds, generally sown in October and November, as water reservoirs fill up.\n\nStrong farm output may also pave the way for resuming exports of key commodities and help soften global prices. India\'s move to ensure domestic food security has hit several poorer nations, with rice prices in Asia climbing to a 15-year high earlier this year.\n\nAsia\'s third-largest economy may stay strong, after recording a growth rate of 8.4% in the final three months of 2023. It would be good for Modi, who is banking on India\'s strong economic prospects, success of the government\'s welfare programs and the fulfillment of populist Hindu-nationalist promises to extend his grip on power.\n\nThe country is also expected to witness a hotter-than-usual summer before monsoon rains in early June, according to the IMD. ""We have already seen two spells of heat waves in April and expect one or two more this month in different parts of the country,"" Mohapatra said.\n\n--With assistance from Ruchi Bhatia and Muneeza Naqvi.\n\n(Updates to add analyst comment, details throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,126,"b'(Bloomberg) -- Days after Tesla Inc.\'s largest-ever round of layoffs and hours before its quarterly earnings, Elon Musk will fly to India to squeeze in a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIt\'s not an idle period for Modi either, who\'s criss-crossing states for election rallies days after voting kicked off in the world\'s biggest ballot where he\'s seeking a third term.\n\nThe tight timing of their meeting early next week underscores the high stakes for both men. For Musk, the prize is India\'s permission for SpaceX\'s Starlink Inc. to operate in what will be by far its biggest market, given China\'s resistance to the American company.\n\nFor Modi, the appearance of Tesla cars in the streets of Delhi and Mumbai -- and a potential investment in manufacturing by the carmaker -- will cast him as a leader who\'s brought marquee foreign investment to India, modernized its cities into global metropolises, and created jobs.\n\n""It\'s symbolic of the growing foreign investor interest in India,"" said Sonal Varma, chief economist for India and Asia ex-Japan at Nomura Holdings Inc. This is ""not just due to supply chain diversification from China for export purposes, but also to take advantage of India\'s burgeoning domestic demand.""\n\nRead More: India Orders Musk\'s X to Block Some Accounts Amid Protests\n\nThe trip is likely to yield breakthroughs on both matters. Musk\'s willingness to travel to India during Modi\'s election campaign -- and his relative silence on the Indian government\'s censorship of speech on X compared with his pitched criticism of limits enforced by authorities in Brazil -- appears to have earned goodwill in Delhi.\n\nStarlink has already received assurances from India\'s government that it will be able to start operating in the country as soon as the third quarter of this year, according to people familiar with the matter who did not want to be identified as the information is not public yet.\n\nThis will end a years-long impasse with the Modi administration and help Starlink close in on two homegrown rivals that secured India licenses for satellite-based internet services last year.\n\nIndia\'s Ministry of Communications didn\'t respond to an email seeking comment. Starlink did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA sizable investment by Tesla, on the other hand, will allow Musk to tap India\'s booming electric vehicle market and counter slowing demand for EVs elsewhere -- a positive spin for the carmaker when Musk speaks on the crucial earnings call Tuesday. Tesla watchers, however, will want to see action on the ground after witnessing delays in previously announced projects such as the massive Mexico plant.\n\nTesla has been trying to break into India for years but high import taxes were a deterrent, something Musk has pointed out repeatedly. India last month lowered import taxes on EVs from foreign carmakers that pledge to invest at least 41.5 billion rupees ($497 million) and start EV production from a local factory within three years.\n\nFrosty China\n\nWhile Starlink\'s services are available in the US, much of Europe and Asian countries such as Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines, India and China haven\'t approved it.\n\nDespite Tesla being a big investor in China and Musk meeting top officials in Beijing and Shanghai during a visit last May and June, the Chinese government has called the SpaceX service an arm of the Pentagon.\n\nThat\'s why winning over India -- the only other giant market with a billion-plus population -- is especially important for SpaceX.\n\nStarlink operations would also mark a further deepening of the security partnership between India and the US, according to Alex Capri, a research fellow for the Singapore-based Hinrich Foundation. The two countries, along with Japan and Australia, are cooperating in the Quad, a Washington DC-led effort to counter China\'s influence.\n\nThe US and India ""are stepping up surveillance in the Indo-Pacific,"" he said. ""Starlink definitely has a role in that.""\n\nCheckered Past\n\nThe firm, however, has had a checkered past with Modi government.\n\nIn 2021, it suffered a setback when the Indian government asked Starlink to stop selling subscriptions to the public before it had even applied for a license. The administration also asked it to refund the subscription fees collected from customers.\n\nSince then, Musk\'s space business in India has been in limbo, stymied in part by a requirement that providers of telecom services have some local ownership. Musk has resisted similar rules in countries such as South Africa and Taiwan.\n\nThe first signs of a thaw came when Modi\'s government introduced last year a bill that proposed to eliminate auctions for allocating spectrum to companies that offer satellite internet services. It was a favorable outcome for Starlink and OneWeb, which told the country\'s telecom regulator they are against bidding for satellite airwaves.\n\nSatellite broadband services are ""also aligned to India\'s digital focus"" and could enable better delivery of government programs, Nomura\'s Varma said.\n\nEasing Rules\n\nIndia in February eased foreign direct investment rules for the space sector allowing companies to invest in manufacturers of satellites and rockets without requiring government approvals.\n\nStarlink will still need to resolve issues related to security approvals, spectrum allocation and pricing plans before it starts operating in India. Once it does, Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and Sunil Mittal-backed OneWeb will have trouble competing, according to Gareth Owen, a UK-based associate director at Counterpoint Research. OneWeb is a subsidiary of Eutelsat Communications SACA.\n\nThe SpaceX unit has more than 5,600 active satellites in low-Earth orbit, with plans to launch tens of thousands more, as it aims to rival telecom providers that use larger and higher orbit satellites that hover over one location.\n\n""Starlink has a major advantage,"" Owen said. ""It has the largest constellation of LEO satellites deployed in orbit, covering most of the regions, and offering connectivity services across the globe.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

129,129,"b'In January, thousands braved the freezing cold at Delhi\'s Red Fort to hear Prime Minister Narendra Modi speak.\n\nHis message was ""Viksit Bharat 2047"", a promise to make India a developed nation by 2047.\n\nIt\'s the latest catchphrase from a man known for his penchant for catchy taglines.\n\n""Developed India"" is an imprecise pledge, but in the 10 years since Mr Modi first stormed to power, he has been trying to lay the foundations for a period of economic boom.\n\nThe prime minister and his government inherited an economy that was teetering on the precipice. Growth was slowing and investor confidence was low. A dozen Indian billionaires had gone bankrupt, saddling the country\'s banks with enormous unpaid loans that had crippled their capacity to lend.\n\nNow, 10 years on, India\'s growth is outpacing other major economies, its banks are strong, and the government\'s finances are stable despite a painful pandemic. India surpassed the UK as the fifth largest economy last year and according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, it\'s on track to overtake Japan and Germany and hit the third spot by 2027.\n\nThere is undoubtedly an air of optimism in the country. It successfully hosted the G20, became the first to send a rocket near the Moon\'s south pole, and has birthed a few dozen unicorns. The soaring stock markets have also had a trickle-down effect on the wealth of its middle class.\n\nOn the face of it ""Modinomics"" - the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\'s economic vision for India - appears to be working. But dig deeper, and the picture is more complex. For a vast swathe of the country\'s 1.4 billion people who live on the margins of sustenance, it\'s not boomtime just as yet.\n\nMr Modi\'s push for digital governance has begun to transform the lives of some of the country\'s poorest people.\n\nToday, Indians in the remotest corners of the country can buy many daily goods without cash, paying as little as 20p for a packet of bread using a QR code on their phone.\n\nUnderpinning this digital revolution is a three-layer system of governance, which includes universal identity cards, a payments infrastructure that enables click-of-a-button money transfer, and a data pillar that gives people access to crucial personal documents like tax returns.\n\nLinking hundreds of millions of bank accounts to this ""digital stack"" has cut red tape and corruption.\n\nEstimates suggest that up to March 2021, an equivalent of about 1.1% of GDP was saved due to digital governance, allowing the government to dole out a volley of social subsidies, cash handouts and also spend on infrastructure building, without running high deficits.\n\nCranes, cranes everywhere!\n\nEverywhere you go in India there are cranes and JCB machines at work giving its creaky public infrastructure a shiny makeover.\n\nTake a look at this slick first underwater metro in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata.\n\nThere\'s no doubt this country is getting a facelift.\n\nBuilding new roads, airports, ports and metros has been the centrepiece of Mr Modi\'s economic policy. He spent over $100bn annually in infrastructure spending (capital expenditure) in the past three years.\n\nNearly 54,000 km (33,554 miles) of national highways were built between 2014 and 2024 - which is twice the length of the preceding 10 years.\n\nThe government has also considerably eased up the bureaucracy, which has been a major bugbear of India\'s economy for decades.\n\nBut Mr Modi\'s policies haven\'t delivered for all.\n\nThe brutal lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, the lingering after-effects of a cash ban in 2016, and faulty implementation of a new goods and services tax - a long pending reform meant to streamline the country\'s welter of indirect taxes - have had far-reaching structural consequences on India\'s economy.\n\nThe country\'s vast unorganised sector - small enterprises that form the backbone of this country - are still reeling under the impact of some of these decisions.\n\nAnd the private sector is not committing big investments. As a proportion of GDP, private investments slumped to barely 19.6% in 2020-21 from a peak of 27.5% in 2007-08.\n\nJobs blues\n\nIn January, thousands gathered outside government recruitment centres in the northern city of Lucknow to go to Israel for jobs in the construction industry. My colleague Archana Shukla was on location.\n\nThe desperation of these workers showed India\'s jobs crisis is real. And it is crushing aspirations everywhere.\n\n""I\'m the first master\'s degree holder in my family,"" says Rukaiya Bepari, a 23-year-old graduate in the town of Miraj in western India.\n\n""But there\'s no industry where I live. So I\'m now taking tuitions. It doesn\'t pay much.""\n\nNeither Rukaiya nor her brother have had full-time work for the last two years. They\'re not alone.\n\nUnemployment among educated youth has doubled from 35.2% to 65.7% between 2000 and 2022, according to latest figures by the Indian Labour Organization, a human rights group.\n\nThere\'s also been no significant growth of real wages in India since 2014, according to numbers computed by noted developmental economist Jean Dreze.\n\nIndia ""risks squandering its demographic dividend"" - the economic growth potential from a big working-age population - the World Bank\'s regional economist said in an interview to the Financial Times recently.\n\nJob creation is a problem Mr Modi has been unable to solve.\n\nRight off the back of his victory in 2014, the prime minister launched an ambitious Make In India campaign to turn India into the world\'s factory. In 2020, his government doled out $25bn in incentives to companies across sectors from semi-conductors to mobile electronics in order to enhance India\'s manufacturing capabilities.\n\nBut success has been elusive.\n\nYes, the likes of Foxconn - which makes iPhones for Apple - are moving their supply chains to India as part of the global ""China plus one"" diversification strategy. Other major global giants like Micron and Samsung have also been enthused to invest. But the numbers are not significant yet.\n\nManufacturing\'s share as a percentage of GDP has remained stagnant in the last decade despite these efforts.\n\nGrowth in exports was also faster under Mr Modi\'s predecessors.\n\n""Even if India\'s manufacturing grows 8% per year till 2050 and China\'s stagnates at the 2022 level, India\'s manufacturing size in 2050 will still not match that of China\'s in 2022,"" says Prof Vidya Mahambare of the Great Lakes Institute of Management.\n\nLack of a large scale industry means half of India\'s population still depends on agriculture for their livelihoods - which is increasingly becoming unprofitable.\n\nTwo speed recovery\n\nA direct impact of this? Squeezed household budgets.\n\nAt 3%, the growth in overall private consumption expenditure - the money people spend on buying things - is the slowest in 20 years.\n\nAnd household debt has touched an all-time high, even as financial savings plunged to their lowest levels, according to new research.\n\nMany economists argue that the nature of India\'s economic growth post pandemic has been uneven, or ""K-shaped"" - where the rich have thrived, while the poor continue to struggle. India may be the fifth largest global economy at an aggregate level, but on a per person basis, it still languishes at the 140th rank.\n\nAnd inequality has widened to a hundred-year high according to research from the World Inequality Database. No surprises then that election campaign discourse recently has been rife with chatter around wealth redistribution and inheritance taxes.\n\nA three day pre-wedding ceremony of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani\'s son recently offered a glimpse into the country\'s new gilded age. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump were in attendance. Rihanna shook a leg with Bollywood\'s biggest celebrities, while the Ambani women flashed diamonds and jewellery once part of the Mughal empire\'s collection.\n\nLuxury brands making cars, watches and liquor have been growing faster than India\'s more mass-market companies, according to Arnab Mitra, who researches Indian consumer brands at Goldman Sachs.\n\nViral Acharya, a professor at NYU Stern, says a handful of the biggest conglomerates have grown ""at the expense of the smallest firms"".\n\nThe super-rich, he says, have benefited from sharp tax cuts and a conscious policy of creating ""national champions"" in which prized public assets like ports and airports have been preferentially given to a few companies to build or run.\n\nLatest court revelations show many of them have also been India\'s top political donors to the ruling BJP.\n\nIndia\'s decade?\n\nAll combined, this presents an inconsistent picture of India\'s economy. But for all its problems, the country is on the runway for take-off, say experts.\n\n""India\'s next decade could resemble China\'s path (of hyper growth) from 2007 through 2012,"" analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a widely discussed paper.\n\nThey add that the country has many advantages - a young demographic, the geopolitics of global de-risking from China and a clean-up of sectors like real estate. Other megatrends like digitalisation, a transition to clean energy and growth in global offshoring will propel future growth, say experts.\n\nThe infra push is also something that will have long-term payoffs. By making improvements in roads, power supply and turnaround time at ports - India is finally ""creating an environment in which manufacturing can flourish"", says DK Joshi, CRISIL\'s India economist.\n\nBut along with the focus on ""physical capital"", Mr Modi needs to pay heed to creating ""human capital"", says Dr Raghuram Rajan, the former governor of India\'s central bank.\n\nIndian children aren\'t learning as well as they should to face up to the world of artificial intelligence. A quarter of those aged 14 to 18 can\'t read simple text fluently, according to a report published by the non-profit Pratham Foundation.\n\nCovid-19 dealt a major blow to students, who couldn\'t attend school for nearly two years. But the government has continued to underfund education, and healthcare.\n\nIn its first decade, Modinomics appears to have delivered for a select few. But for many the jar, as it appears, is still half empty.\n\n""We will grow old before we grow rich"" if growth isn\'t faster and more equitable, says Dr Rajan.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The so-called fear gauge, which hit a record low just two weeks ago, is now approaching its highest close since early 2023.\n\nModi is still widely expected to win a third five-year term in the marathon election that began April 19 and will run through June 1, with the leader having predicted that his Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies will win more than 400 of the 543 seats up for grabs in the lower house of parliament.\n\nHowever, attention has recently shifted to a dip in voter turnout during the first two phases of voting and media reports have fanned some speculation among equity traders of a less emphatic performance for the ruling coalition. In the last election in 2019, the BJP expanded its majority to 303 seats, and the alliance it leads currently commands 353 seats.\n\n""There is a chatter that BJP may win 290-300 seats and if that happens, markets will surely see a blip,"" said Mukesh Jain, managing director of Jaipur-based Maverick Share Brokers Pvt, which has been tracking the markets for over two decades.\n\nIndia\'s benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid as much as 0.9% in a third day of declines on Tuesday, heading for its lowest close since April 19. That\'s even as a broader gauge of Asian stocks advanced for a fourth day. Turnover in equity derivatives has also slumped to its lowest since December.\n\nLast week, the Election Commission of India said it was disappointed with the turnout so far and is taking measures to boost participation in the remaining phases of polling. On Tuesday, voting kicked off in Modi\'s home state of Gujarat in what is the third phase of the election. The winner will be declared on June 4. A party needs 272 seats in parliament to have a majority.\n\nRead: Modi\'s Home State Votes in Heated Indian Election Campaign\n\n""There is a creeping likelihood that the deviation between reality and expectations in terms of seats that the BJP-led alliance can win could be high,"" said Dhananjay Sinha, co-head of equities at Systematix Group. ""This is leading to quite a bit of uncertainty in the market. It\'s very likely that the recent jump in VIX is reflecting this concern in the market.""\n\nTo be sure, a victory for Modi\'s party still remains the most-anticipated outcome for traders. And based on India\'s past political history, there\'s no link between lower voter turnout and support for the incumbent party.\n\n""Frankly, I don\'t see any possibility of this,"" Jain of Maverick Share Brokers said when asked about the changes of the BJP-led alliance failing to win the election. ""I haven\'t really thought of this scenario.""\n\nFurther, the recent weakness in Indian stocks is coming after a period of extended outperformance versus regional peers. Strategists at global banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have said that Indian equities are set to attract more foreign inflows post the general elections on bets that Modi, who has promised continued spending on infrastructure, will return to power.\n\nRead more: Earnings Signal India May Return to Winning Ways: Taking Stock\n\n--With assistance from Nasreen Seria and Jeanette Rodrigues.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
131,131,"b'By Aditya Kalra, Munsif Vengattil and Dhwani Pandya\n\nMUMBAI, April 22 (Reuters) - In fake videos that have gone viral online, two of India\'s A-lister Bollywood actors are seen criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asking people to vote for the opposition Congress party in the country\'s ongoing general election.\n\nIn a 30-second video that shows Aamir Khan and another 41-second clip of Ranveer Singh, the two Bollywood actors purportedly say Modi failed to keep campaign promises and failed to address critical economic issues during his two terms as prime minister.\n\nBoth AI-generated videos end with the Congress election symbol and slogan: ""Vote for Justice, Vote for Congress"".\n\nThe two videos have been viewed on social media more than half a million times since last week, a Reuters review shows.\n\nTheir spread underlines the potential role such AI (artificial intelligence)-generated content can play in the mammoth Indian election that started on Friday and will continue until June. AI and AI-generated fakes, or deepfakes, are being increasingly used in elections elsewhere in the world, including in the U.S., Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nCampaigning in India has long focused on door-to-door outreach and public rallies, but extensive use of WhatsApp and Facebook as campaigning tools started in 2019. This year\'s general election - in which Modi is expected to secure a rare third term - is the first in which AI is being used.\n\nA Congress spokesperson, Sujata Paul, shared actor Singh\'s video with her 16,000 followers on X on April 17 and by Saturday afternoon, her post had been reshared 2,900 times, liked 8,700 times and received 438,000 views.\n\nPaul told Reuters by telephone she was aware the video was marked ""manipulated media"" by X, but she did not want to delete it as, while posting, she thought the person was a look alike of Singh and ""it has creativity for sure"".\n\nThe post was no longer visible on X on Sunday, hours after Reuters sent a request for comment to Congress\' head of social media cell, who did not respond.\n\nBoth actors have said the videos are fake. Facebook, X and at least eight fact-checking websites have said they are altered or manipulated, which the Reuters digital verification unit has also confirmed.\n\nReuters could not ascertain who created the videos. Khan was ""alarmed"" by the viral ""fake"" video and Singh\'s team was looking into the matter, according to a spokesperson for both actors. Singh wrote on X on Friday: ""Beware of deepfakes, friends"".\n\nModi\'s office, and the IT head of his Bharatiya Janata Party, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPOLICE PROBE\n\nNearly 900 million people in India have access to the Internet and a survey conducted by research organization Esya Centre and the Indian Institute of Management business school showed an average Indian spends over three hours a day on social media. The country has nearly one billion voters.\n\nSome versions of the videos have been blocked on social media but at least 14 were still visible on X on Saturday. Facebook deleted two videos Reuters flagged to the company but one other was still visible.\n\nFacebook in a statement said it has ""removed the videos"" for violation of its policies. X did not respond to Reuters queries.\n\nThe videos have sparked one police investigation with Khan registering a case in Mumbai against unnamed persons on April 17 for alleged impersonation and cheating for creating the fake video.\n\nMumbai police did not return a request for comment, but two officers working on Khan\'s case, who declined to be named, said they wrote to Facebook and X to take down the video and the companies had said it was done.\n\nThe officers said they were up until 2 a.m. on Friday, refreshing pages to check if Khan\'s online videos were removed. Asked about progress in the case, one of them said: ""Such technical investigations take time.""\n\nAI VIDEO OF DEAD FATHER\n\nIn this year\'s election, politicians are using AI in other ways.\n\nIn southern India, Congress leader Vijay Vasanth\'s spokesperson said his team has created a 2-minute audio-video clip using AI that was shared on social media platforms and shows his now dead but more popular politician father, H. Vasanthakumar, seeking votes for him.\n\nThe late politician is seen saying ""even though my body left you all, my soul is still around.""\n\nIn videos put out on YouTube by the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM), Samata, an AI-generated anchor dressed in a traditional saree and speaking in a style that mimics regular news channels, criticizes the ruling party in West Bengal state.\n\nIn one clip, the anchor alleges the party does not care about the environment as many water bodies have vanished due to illegal construction.\n\nA spokesperson for the ruling party denied the allegation and said the state government has ensured no such construction takes place. The CPM did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the video, which has been seen 12,000 times, anchor Samata declares: ""These are questions that we the citizens of this city need to ponder over.""

135,135,"b'(Bloomberg) -- The high tide for global interest rates has passed, but respite for the world economy may be limited as policymakers stay wary at the threat of inflation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThat\'s the dominant theme this year prevailing across 23 major central banks tracked by Bloomberg. All but three are seen set to reduce borrowing costs -- but the pace of easing for many of them looks ever less likely to mirror the aggressive speed at which tightening first took hold.\n\nEven if renewed US inflation concerns prove unfounded enough that the Federal Reserve can begin steady rate cutting, the grip of monetary policy on the world won\'t get markedly looser, according to Bloomberg Economics.\n\nIts aggregate measure of borrowing costs across advanced economies is set to fall less than 100 basis points by the end of 2024. That\'s not as much as it rose last year, and just a fraction of the 435 basis-point increase seen since mid-2021. And the lag in transmission means easing effects will take more time to feed through.\n\nSuch a policy path reflects how central bankers are treading a fine line between aiding anemic economies and guarding against a resurgence in consumer-price growth, potentially aggravated by another energy shock. A cloudier outlook for the Fed and the shadow of US presidential elections won\'t help either.\n\nGeopolitical tension, with conflict between Israel and Iran threatening conflagration in the Middle East, is an additional risk variable.\n\n""Premature easing could see new inflation surprises that may even necessitate a further bout of monetary tightening,"" International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said in a speech last Thursday heralding her institution\'s meetings in Washington this week. ""On the other side, delaying too long could pour cold water on economic activity.""\n\nPolicy may remain constricted in South Africa and Argentina and even tighter in crisis-ridden Nigeria, while Japan is poised to continue its exit from ultra-loose settings. But for most of the world, rate-cutting cycles poised either to begin or advance may offer only mild relief to consumers and businesses.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""2024 was shaping up to be a year of slumping growth, steadying prices, and early and aggressive rate cuts. Now, it\'s looking more like a year of resilient growth, persistent price pressure, and policy normalization that starts later and proceeds at a more measured pace. For the financial markets, shifting expectations on the Fed, ECB and BOE, as well as a wild card as the BOJ wriggles free of its stimulus straitjacket, add up to a period of pivot peril.""\n\n-- Tom Orlik, global chief economist\n\nHere is Bloomberg\'s quarterly guide to the outlook for the world\'s top central banks, which set rate policy for a combined 90% of the global economy.\n\nFed officials will be watching for signs in the second quarter that inflation is still headed firmly toward their 2% target rate.\n\nAfter easing rapidly last year, price pressures have picked back up in 2024. That\'s raised concerns about the inflation outlook and whether the figures are a mere blip -- as Fed officials have long warned -- or a more concerning sign that progress has stalled.\n\nRecent consumer price data suggested the latter, with a key gauge of underlying inflation topping economists\' expectations for a third-straight month in March. Investors now bet the US central bank will cut just twice this year, starting in September, according to futures markets as of April 11.\n\nMuch rests on the next few months of data -- from the timing of the first rate cut to the total number of cuts this year. Most officials currently see two or three rate reductions in 2024, but an extended pause in inflation progress or an unexpected weakening in the labor market could very well alter the picture.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""With inflation prints surprising on the high side in 1Q 24, we have pushed back our expectation for the first Fed rate cut to July. But we still expect a total of 100-bps cuts in 2024, more than 75-bps that the median Fed official projected in the latest summary of economic projections, and more than the two-cuts markets now priced for. That\'s because we see unemployment rising incrementally in the rest of the year, reaching 4.7% by end-year. The Fed is beholden to its dual mandate, and will have to cut even as inflation is fluctuating around 3%.""\n\nThe ECB is on track to cut rates at its next meeting in June after President Christine Lagarde laid firmer groundwork for such a move at last week\'s press conference.\n\nThat would seal the euro zone\'s status as the first of the world\'s major economic jurisdictions to start easing. Some officials want the ECB to keep going after that, but Lagarde refuses to be drawn on any potential further steps.\n\nWith investors doubting the Fed\'s appetite to cut anytime soon, the ECB could find itself going it alone. While that would burnish a willingness not to follow the US lead, it also risks casting light on any difference that might emerge in the cost of borrowing on either side of the Atlantic.\n\nInflation threats posed by possible euro weakening that could result, or a potential surge in the oil price, might yet brake the ECB\'s efforts to reduce constriction on a tepid economy.\n\nLagarde insisted last week that her central bank is ""not Fed dependent."" But she did acknowledge that the US is a ""very sizable economy"" and that any implications from there will feed its way into staff forecasts produced for the June 6 decision.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""The ECB is preparing to lower rates. Headline inflation and measures of underlying price increases are rapidly decelerating, and wage growth is slowing. However, the Governing Council is still waiting for data from 1Q24 to confirm that inflation is on the right trajectory and cost pressures continue to abate. Our view is the ECB will cut by 25 bps in June, and, after a pause in July, by the same amount in September, October and December.""\n\nThe key question for the Bank of Japan is how fast it will continue normalizing policy after scrapping the world\'s last negative interest rate and calling time on its massive monetary easing program in March. Market players are keen for clarity on the timing of its next rate hike and the specifics of how it will unwind its gigantic balance sheet. The pace will depend on the central bank\'s confidence in a stable inflation path, with new quarterly economic projections in April likely to offer an important signal.\n\nMost BOJ watchers expect the next rate hike by October with many of them warning of a possible earlier move with the feeble yen hovering around a 34-year low. If the government intervenes to try and stem the tide of currency weakness without success, the spotlight could quickly fall on Governor Kazuo Ueda to help out. Still, raising rates quickly would be a tough decision when the economy is still sputtering.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""The BOJ will move to secure a rate buffer in case inflation loses steam because resurrection of the unconventional policy is the last thing it wants. The core CPI inflation expected to register above 2% for a while -- helped by lower base reflecting last year\'s energy subsidies -- will provide good optics for tightening. We see the BOJ raise its rate target from a 0%-0.1% range now to 0.15%-0.25% in July, followed by another hike to 0.4%-0.5% in October.""\n\nBy the June decision, the Bank of England could be given confidence to cut by data that is likely to show headline inflation sinking below its 2% target, and the impact of wage settlements for the crucial month of April.\n\nGovernor Andrew Bailey has been guarded on the exact timing of a reduction but recently said the UK is ""on the way"" to cutting rates after a shift in tone from the central bank\'s rate-setters. While the next meeting in May, which includes a new round of forecasts, is seen as too soon for a pivot, the Monetary Policy Committee could use the decision signal an imminent shift is ahead.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""With headline inflation on course to fall below 2% in coming months, the Bank of England is likely to start easing in the summer. We think the first move down will be in June, with cuts at each meeting until the end of 2024. That would mean rates end the year at 4%. Slower cuts are likely in 2025 as the central bank feels its way toward neutral.""\n\nThe Bank of Canada\'s governing council is actively debating when it can start to lower the benchmark from 5% after getting better-than-expected inflation prints to start the year. Still, economic growth is running hotter, and officials said they need to see more evidence to be confident price pressures are sustainably returning to the 2% target.\n\nIn press conference after the April decision, Governor Tiff Macklem told reporters a June cut was ""within the realm of possibilities."" Economists expect policymakers to ease monetary policy at that meeting, and the two inflation prints leading up to the decision are crucial guideposts in determining how much earlier the central bank will end up frontrunning the Fed.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""A looming slowdown in economic activity sets the stage for a pivot this summer -- we think in July. Though odds of swifter cuts increased as inflation surprised to the downside, the BoC is likely unconvinced that underlying inflation pressures have been fully tamed. Resilient demand and home price pressures -- downstream of population growth and immigration -- increase the odds of a secondary surge in inflation if monetary policy becomes accommodative too quickly.""\n\nChina\'s first quarter growth might beat estimates, according to strong early data. But the PBOC is expected to stick to its easing path, given weak inflation, a sinking property market, and the relatively ambitious GDP growth target of around 5% for this year.\n\nWorries about a weakening currency are weighing on Beijing\'s mind, limiting the chance of bold reductions to key landing rates before any Fed decision on easing. A cut to bank reserve requirements is likely to come first, with several economists expecting a 25-50bp reduction in the second quarter.\n\nThe PBOC is seen as likely to step up lending to policy banks to support housing and infrastructure projects. While excitement about new QE-like monetary tools is growing, such innovations appear to be a way off yet.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""We expect the PBOC to lower its one-year policy rate by 10 basis points to 2.40% in 2Q and deliver two more cuts of similar magnitude by the end of the year. Policymakers need to fight deflation in producer prices and downward pressure on consumer prices. Cushioning the housing correction also requires more stimulus. A constraint on the PBOC has been the weak yuan. The prospect of Fed easing in 2Q should make it easier for the PBOC to move.""\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India kept benchmark rate unchanged at 6.5% for the seventh straight review in April, while Governor Shaktikanta Das\'s hawkish tones dashed hopes of an early cut.\n\n""We derive satisfaction from the progress made under disinflation, but the task is not yet finished,"" Das said in his interaction with the media after the policy, vowing to maintain an unwavering focus on lowering the inflation near its target 4%. Inflation in March moderated for three straight months, but the print is still nearly a percentage point away from the target. Maintaining lower inflation is critical for Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a rare third term in elections starting next week.\n\nForecasts of high temperatures in April, May and June that could damage crops and push up food prices have also complicated the inflation management task for the central bank. For now, the RBI will watch out for the impact of an uncertain weather, and also wait to see the full transmission of its past 250 basis points rate increases getting fully transmitted through banking channels.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""We see the RBI delaying its easing cycle to August for three reasons. It has a false sense of comfort from a spurt in 4Q23 GDP growth that had a shaky foundation, it wants to see inflation dropping further to target, and it wants to follow, not pre-empt a Fed rate cut. The unwarranted hawkish bias now is likely to give way to deeper cuts later. We expect a total of 150 bps of cuts by 3Q25, taking the repo rate to 5.0%.""\n\nBrazil\'s central bank has signaled one more rate cut of 50 basis points at its next decision in May and opened the door to smaller reductions thereafter. Policymakers led by Roberto Campos Neto say heightened uncertainty forced them to change forward guidance that had previously indicated an easing path for two meetings ahead.\n\nWhile annual inflation slowed more than expected in March, services costs remain elevated, prompting concerns about pressures from a tight labor market. Waning economic activity has pushed President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva\'s government to increase spending, possibly leading to a more gradual consumer price slowdown toward target.\n\nDoubts about the central bank\'s tolerance for inflation once Lula appoints a new governor later this year have also kept investors\' consumer price estimates above the 3% target for months.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""We expect the BCB to halve its rate-cut pace to 25 basis points per meeting in June, and extend it through year end. Concerns about global inflation, slower monetary easing in advanced economies and a tight labor market at home warrant a more cautious pace. Unanchored long-term inflation expectations may impede the process. Our 9% year-end Selic forecast implies a 5.5% ex-ante real rate -- between neutral and slightly contractionary monetary policy.""\n\nAfter holding its key rate at 16% throughout the first quarter, the Bank of Russia signaled ""a long period"" of tight monetary conditions this year as it highlighted uncertainty over the economy amid persistent high inflation and worsening foreign trade due to sanctions over the war in Ukraine.\n\nAt their March 22 meeting, policymakers noted ""proinflationary surprises"" in data on a tightening labor market and consumer spending and lending that meant the risks underlying inflation would remain high ""or go up are significant.""\n\nVladimir Putin\'s inauguration in May for a fifth term as president may be followed by a government shake-up that could impact policy as the state continues to spend heavily on the war including defense production.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""With rates at 16%, the Bank of Russia runs the region\'s tightest policy. Despite this, enterprise and household surveys are yet to show signs of cooling activity. The central bank\'s likely to start cutting in June as reports confirm inflation\'s on track to reach the 4% SAAR target in 4Q24. Still, the current easing cycle will be slow as policymakers would want to avoid hurting the currency with premature cuts.""\n\nSouth Africa\'s central bank is set to maintain its key rate at a 15-year high this quarter as risks to its inflation outlook remain from higher oil prices, drought conditions and a resurgent dollar even as election uncertainty prevails. Governor Lesetja Kganyago and two of his deputies\' terms were extended for another five years last month assuring policy continuity as the country prepares for elections on May 29 that could reshape its political landscape.\n\nOpinion polls show that the ruling African National Congress may lose its majority for the first time since coming to power in 1994. ""We deal with uncertainty all the time, elections are just one uncertainty we have to deal with,"" Kganyago said recently. ""We will still make decisions the same way.""\n\nThe central bank prefers to peg inflation expectations at the midpoint of its 3% to 6% target range. Kganyago has repeatedly said it will only lower rates once inflation retreats to the 4.5% midpoint and is sustained there.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""Resilient price pressures will keep the SARB from cutting rates this year. Reducing inflation to the mid-point of the central bank\'s 3%-6% target is taking longer than anticipated. We foresee dry conditions having only modest effects on the cost of food. Fuel prices will likely tick up in the second quarter. The president\'s reappointment of Kganyago to another five years as governor of the SARB, signals continuity in a year laden with political uncertainty.""\n\nMexico\'s central bank, known as Banxico, has promised that any further rate cuts after its initial reduction in March will be gradual. Latin America\'s second-largest economy has had robust domestic demand and sticky core inflation that has left some policymakers worried.\n\nThe bank has not ruled out further easing in coming meetings, with Governor Victoria Rodriguez saying they would have to decide ""step-by-step."" Still, the five board members could remain split over the proper way to proceed. The one dissenting member in the last decision, in which the bank lowered the key rate to 11%, said she thought reductions were premature.\n\nMexico\'s inflation is expected to nearly reach the 3% target by the second quarter of 2025.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""Banxico cut rates to 11% in March, the firist such move since the end of the tightening cycle one year earlier. Decelerating inflation and lower expectations provide room for some more accommodation, but they are poised to remain above the target and limit the downside. Slower growth consistent with a narrowing positive output gap also supports a gradual adjustment. US rates are a constraint. We see Banxico slowly cutting rates, but monetary conditions still tight in 2024.""\n\nRupiah weakness will be top of mind for Bank Indonesia this quarter as the incoming government brings with it fresh fiscal risks that\'s spurred heavy bond outflows. President-elect Prabowo Subianto\'s signature campaign pledge of free lunches for 80 million school children is expected to cost about 2% of GDP and has elicited warnings from credit raters.\n\nAlongside a widening current-account deficit, declining foreign exchange reserves and stubbornly high food prices, Bank Indonesia will unlikely be in a rush to lower its policy rate until the second half of this year once there\'s greater clarity about the Fed\'s own easing path. It may look to lower reserve requirements, though, as a way to support bank lending in Southeast Asia\'s largest economy.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""Bank Indonesia is likely to cut rates by 75 bps in 2024, but it won\'t move until after the Fed starts easing. Jumping the gun would narrow the rate differential - undercutting the rupiah, which it\'s worked hard to prop up. Capital inflows are also vulnerable to a reversal if the global slowdown cools risk appetite. Another hurdle is inflation. BI is wary of a breach of its new inflation target. This likely keeps BI rates on hold in 1H24.""\n\nTurkey\'s central bank is expected to hold its benchmark rate tight throughout the second quarter, with expectations that inflation will begin to slow as of June, after peaking above 70% in the coming months.\n\nPolicymakers have said the rates could be tightened further should the inflation outlook deteriorate. The central bank is likely to focus on sidesteps to cool demand and curb credit growth while trying to encourage savings in Turkish lira during this period. Risks to the inflation outlook include any potential interim hike to the minimum wage and the central bank has urged to government to refrain from such a step.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""The CBRT\'s cumulative 4150-bps of rate hikes since May 2023 may not be the end of its restrictive steps. The central bank will likely deliver additional tightening ahead via its rate corridor and alternative tools such as reserve requirements. An outsized hike to the government\'s tax and fee schedule, or a mid-year lift in the minimum wage could see the central bank deliver further hikes, or delay cuts.""\n\nHaving delivered a combined 600 basis-point increase in the first quarter of the year, the risk of another rate hike in Nigeria has reduced. Its willingness to act has stabilized the naira, closed the gap with the parallel market rate and led to the return of foreign investors.\n\nKey to what it does next will be the impact on inflation of a recent threefold increase in electricity tariffs that will affect millions of residents and businesses in the urban areas and talks of a new minimum wage in May. The inflation rate has been at more than triple the top end of the central bank\'s 6% to 9% target range since October.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""Nigeria is nearing the end of its hiking cycle, helped by an appreciating naira. A threefold increase in electricity tariffs in April will place upward pressure on inflation this quarter. We expect two more rate hikes this year, taking the policy rate to around 28% by mid-2024. Inflation is likely to start a very slow turn, thereafter, closing out 2024 around 30%. Persistent price pressures will keep rates elevated over the next couple of years.""\n\nBank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong set the scene for a potential policy pivot later this year as the board decided to keep the benchmark rate on hold for a 10th consecutive time on Friday. Revealing that no one in the board is ruling out the possibility of a rate cut if inflation decelerates to 2.3% in the second half as expected, Rhee said May will be an important month for the bank because that\'s when key economic and inflation data are due.\n\nThe change in his tone comes after in February he pushed back against speculation for an early policy pivot and sought to keep the focus on fighting inflation. While reiterating the bank prioritized helping to rein in prices, Rhee said the bank now wanted to create room for an eventual policy change. In a policy statement after the decision, the bank indeed removed ""long"" from its previous pledge to keep the rate restrictive ""for sufficiently long.""\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""The Bank of Korea isn\'t ready to shift away from its restrictive stance yet. Inflation is trending downward but the final stretch to its 2% target will be bumpy and uncertain - arguing for more patience. One thing is clear -- its next move will be a cut, probably in August. Weakening domestic demand and stability risks from a highly leveraged property sector will call for more accommodation once its inflation goal looks secure.""\n\nThe RBA has signaled it\'s probably concluded an 18-month policy tightening campaign after taking borrowing costs to a 12-year high in an effort to quell inflation. Most economists expect the RBA\'s next move will be down, with an easing cycle expected to begin in earnest in the second half of the year.\n\nGovernor Michele Bullock has repeatedly highlighted that the rate path is uncertain. Just last month, she said the board can\'t rule ""anything in or out,"" indicating that she isn\'t yet ready to pivot to an easing stance, unlike counterparts in other developed markets. Australia\'s central bank meets next on May 6-7 and by then will have seen a key inflation reading for the first three months of 2024.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""The RBA has done more than enough to ensure inflation returns to its 2%-3% target bans in a reasonable timeframe. The central bank is likely to pivot to policy easing in 2024. We expect the data will reveal a further slowdown in growth as rapid passthrough of rate hikes thus far hit consumer spending hard through 1H24. Swift policy passthrough means the RBA has less room to hold rates at their peak before policy needs to pivot to supporting growth.""\n\nAnnual inflation under President Javier Milei is running at a three-decade-high of 276%. Still, month-on-month price rises are dwindling, and Economy Minister Luis Caputo has said March\'s reading will come in at 10%. That\'s down from 26% in December, when Milei lifted price controls and devalued the currency.\n\nCentral Bank Chief Santiago Bausili has cut the benchmark rate from 133% to 80% since taking office in an aim to reduce interest payments on peso notes. Lower March inflation projections have fueled speculation of another reduction. However, the International Monetary Fund, which Argentina owes $44 billion, has laid out the expectation for rates to exceed inflation in order to encourage savings in pesos.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""The BCRA has relied on negative real rates to erode the value of its interest-bearing liabilities -a move only possible due to currency controls. Once those are eased or lifted, real rates will have to be positive. That can be done without raising the nominal rate if inflation expectations continue to fall - which depends crucially on a sustainable fiscal adjustment.""\n\nThe Swiss National Bank surprised investors last month by delivering the first rate cut yet seen this cycle from one of the world\'s 10 most-traded currency jurisdictions.\n\nUnexpectedly slow inflation data since then has so far vindicated that decision by policymakers including departing President Thomas Jordan.\n\nEconomists expect a slight acceleration in consumer-price growth over the coming months due to trickling down rent increases. But with inflation now at just 1%, that\'s unlikely to pose much of a worry. Two more cuts this year look probable.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""The SNB in March surprised markets by cutting its policy rate, moving ahead of the ECB and the Fed. Concerns over stoking upside risks on the currency, as major central banks gear up for their first moves, likely played a key role in this decision. With inflation due to stay comfortably below the SNB\'s 2% upper bound, we expect the central bank to cut its rate again twice more, to 1%, by year-end.""\n\nThe world\'s oldest central bank has charted a path to easing that indicates it could announce a rate cut either May 8 or June 23, though a sharp depreciation of the Swedish krona that started in mid-March illustrates that currency moves remain a risk for Governor Erik Thedeen and his colleagues. Any further krona weakening that threatens to fuel import prices would lower policymakers appetite for moving ahead of the ECB\'s expected reduction in June.\n\nEither way, the Riksbank has signaled that it plans to loosen monetary conditions at a modest pace after the initial move, allowing them to take stock of the impact of rate cuts before continuing to ease. The bank\'s current guidance indicates that its benchmark rate may be cut by 75 basis points, to 3.25%, by the end of this year.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""The Riksbank surprised in March with a dovish message on a likely rate cut in May or June. We think the probable hit to the already weak krona from a kick off to the easing cycle far in advance of other major central banks - the ECB in June and the Fed in July, in our view - make the latter date more probable.""\n\nNorway\'s central bank is set to begin lowering borrowing costs from a 16-year high of 4.5% in the autumn, most likely in September, according to its latest outlook. Underlying inflation slowed last month more than forecast, countering recent signs of resilience to high credit costs in the energy-rich economy and suggesting the policymakers may not need to delay monetary easing to the end of the year.\n\nGovernor Ida Wolden Bache and other rate-setters have cited uncertainty on krone moves as another crucial factor that speaks in favor of a cautious stance. A wage deal between industrial unions and employers last weekend also signaled heightened risks for cost inflation as it secured somewhat bigger pay increases than expected. The central bank doesn\'t expect to reach its 2%-target on inflation on an average annual basis even by 2027, according to its latest economic projections last month.\n\nThe RBNZ is talking tough, saying it won\'t cut rates until 2025 in order to be sure that inflation, currently running at 4.7%, returns to its 2% target. Price pressures have been more persistent than policymakers would like as surging immigration swells the population and boosts costs such as rents. But with the economy in recession and expected to stay weak for much of this year, investors and most economists are picking a pivot to monetary easing sometime in the next six months. The RBNZ\'s chief economist has also acknowledged that if the Fed cuts\n\nfirst, that may hasten New Zealand easing by driving up the exchange rate and damping imported inflation.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""The RBNZ\'s hawkish stance is unrealistic, and won\'t last long. The full effects of 525 basis points of tightening since October 2021 are being felt, with the economy contracting, unemployment rising and inflation cooling. Bloomberg Economics expects the boost from strong migration will fade fast in early 2024, and a shift in economic reality will drive a policy pivot. Rate cuts are likely to arrive sooner than anticipated, in the mid- to late-24, as the focus switches from fighting inflation to reviving demand.""\n\nPoland\'s central bank will likely hold off from cutting rates this year as policy makers expect inflation to flare up again as the government restores higher taxes on food and energy.\n\nThe administration of Prime Minister Donald Tusk is phasing out measures that the previous cabinet imposed in the wake of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine to curb surging prices. Inflation is now back within the central bank\'s target for the first time in three years after peaking at 18.4% in February last year.\n\nFor Governor Adam Glapinski the outlook may worsen as government measures kick in and wages continue to grow rapidly. But he may have bigger concerns, too. The ruling coalition is planning to start a parliamentary probe after accusing Glapinski of political meddling before last year\'s election and other irregularities. The governor has denied any wrong doing.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n""Poland is likely to hold the reference rate at 5.75% until June and cut to 5.25% by end 2024. The timing of the cuts will depend on core inflation and the strength of the economic recovery. The recent downside surprises in inflation will likely nudge policymakers toward a more dovish stance. One major risk stems from the growing frictions between the government and the central bank\'s governor Adam Glapinski, which could spook markets.""\n\nThe Czechs have accelerated policy easing this year, delivering half-point cuts in February and March, as inflation hit the 2% target sooner than expected. The central bank signaled it will keep lowering borrowing costs, but less than implied in its forecast that sees the end-year level at 2.6%\n\nGovernor Ales Michl has warned that risks including rising costs for services and a weaker exchange rate could slow or halt rate cuts if they threaten to push inflation higher again. ""That\'s why the bank board believes it\'s necessary to maintain a restrictive monetary policy and to keep approaching further rate cuts with caution,"" he said after the March meeting.\n\n--With assistance from Beril Akman, Maya Averbuch, Bastian Benrath, Matthew Brockett, Maria Eloisa Capurro, Alice Gledhill, Tony Halpin, Tom Hancock, Erik Hertzberg, James Hirai, Claire Jiao, Scott Johnson (Economist), Sam Kim, Peter Laca, Matthew Malinowski, Nduka Orjinmo, Swati Pandey, Reade Pickert, Tom Rees, Niclas Rolander, Piotr Skolimowski, Ntando Thukwana, Manuela Tobias, Ott Ummelas and Monique Vanek.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,136,"b'(Reuters) - Tesla is expected to report its lowest gross profit margin in more than six years on Tuesday after a chaotic week that included major layoffs, vehicle price cuts and urgent calls by investors for clarity on product strategy.\n\nTesla\'s chief, Elon Musk, likely will face pointed questions from investors on the post-results conference call about the fate of the so-called Model 2, a low-cost vehicle he had promised in January would be available in 2025.\n\nReuters exclusively reported on April 5 that Tesla had scrapped plans for the model and shifted focus to building a self-driving robotaxi on the same small-car platform. Musk initially posted on social media that ""Reuters is lying"" but has yet to identify any inaccuracies or clarify the fate of the model. Investors had pinned hopes for sales increases on the Model 2.\n\nGraham Tanaka, a portfolio manager at Tanaka Growth Fund who was an early bull in Tesla shares, said he had liquidated the last of his position in recent days because of the uncertainty over the Model 2 and slow production of the Cybertruck electric pickup.\n\n""The Model 2 was supposed to be the moat around their business model, but it\'s been delayed at a minimum,"" he said. ""We think there\'s going to be more risk in owning Tesla next year because we don\'t know how fast the Cybertruck will be ramping up.""\n\nThe billionaire CEO had been expected to meet with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and announce major investments in an auto factory that had been expected to produce a small, affordable model. Musk canceled at the last minute, citing ""very heavy Tesla obligations.""\n\nFor now, Tesla\'s sales growth is slowing, which is expected to weigh heavily on Tuesday\'s results. The automaker earlier this month reported an 8.5% decline in deliveries and rising inventories. Over the weekend, Tesla announced the latest in a series of price cuts globally on its Model 3, Model Y and other models, further eating in to margins.\n\nSeveral analysts expect Tesla\'s annual deliveries to fall for the first time in 2024 after years of double-digit growth. Tesla warned in January that deliveries growth would be ""notably lower"" this year, signaling that price cuts would be insufficient to lift demand.\n\nTesla shares have lost about 43% so far this year as of Monday afternoon.\n\nWall Street expects automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits to be 15.2%, according to 20 analysts polled by Visible Alpha, down from 19% a year earlier and the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nThe automaker could also face questions about its struggle to mass-produce its newer 4680 batteries, which Tesla needs for the Cybertruck and hoped to deploy in other models to reduce costs.\n\nTesla\'s battery chief, Andrew Baglino, resigned last week as the company started layoffs expected to include more than 10% of its global workforce.\n\nROBOTAXI FUTURE?\n\nTesla remains the world\'s most valuable automaker with a market capitalization of about $468 billion, but that is down by two-thirds from its record highs reached in November 2021. Its valuation has historically been based largely on hopes for mass-market EV sales and breakthroughs in self-driving vehicles.\n\nSince the Reuters report on the shift in Model 2 strategy, analysts have noted such a change could cause an exodus from the shares by investors who had been betting on rapid sales growth. Those investors, analysts said, would likely be replaced by others who are willing to wait for self-driving Teslas.\n\nMusk has predicted the imminent arrival of fully autonomous cars for years but may still be years from delivering, given the steep engineering and regulatory challenges. Tesla faces lawsuits and investigations into its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems, which do not make vehicles fully autonomous.\n\nMusk has raised more questions with recent social media posts about Tesla\'s self-driving vehicle strategy. He recently teased a ""Robotaxi unveil"" on ""8/8,"" presumably meaning August 2024, and he later posted that going ""balls to the wall"" on autonomy was a ""blindingly obvious"" move.\n\nTo spark consumer interest, Tesla recently offered a free trial for Full Self-Driving and over the weekend cut the option\'s price to $8,000 from $12,000.\n\nAs Tesla looks to bolster sales and margins, it may not get much help its latest model, the Cybertruck, which has proved difficult for the automaker to mass-produce. The company does not report production figures for the pickup separately, but it last week recalled nearly 3,900 of the vehicles that were produced between its introduction last November and April.\n\nInvestors on Tuesday will likely seek guidance on whether Musk maintains his goal of producing 200,000 Cybertrucks in 2025. Musk said the model would not produce positive cash flow until 2025.\n\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; additional reporting by David Randall in New York; Editing by Brian Thevenot and Matthew Lewis)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

138,138,"b'Unemployment, inflation are key concerns for voters\n\n*\n\nModi says investment in infrastructure will create jobs\n\nNEW DELHI, April 14 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised on Sunday to create jobs, boost infrastructure and expand welfare programmes if it wins a third term, seeking to address key voter concerns ahead of next week\'s elections.\n\nThe general election, which begins on April 19, will be held in seven stages until June 1. Votes are due to be counted on June 4 and results expected the same day.\n\nModi, 73, is widely tipped to win a record-equalling third term on the back of his 10-year record, which includes strong economic growth, infrastructure projects, welfare handouts and aggressive Hindu nationalism.\n\nSurveys, however, suggest unemployment, inflation and rural distress remain issues of concern in the world\'s most populous country despite its strong economy, and addressing these will be Modi\'s biggest challenge.\n\n""Our focus is on dignity of life ... on quality of life, our focus is also on creating jobs through investment,"" Modi said after releasing the manifesto, titled \'Modi\'s Guarantee\', at the party headquarters in the capital.\n\nModi said the manifesto is focused on creating jobs in sectors such as infrastructure, aviation, railways, electric vehicles, green energy, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, among others, in a bid to address discontent at unemployment levels that are rising despite strong economic growth.\n\n""India\'s youth will not have even imagined the number of opportunities that will come their way,"" he told cheering BJP members, including top federal ministers who sat in the audience wearing stoles featuring the BJP\'s lotus symbol.\n\nFOCUS ON WELFARE\n\nModi also vowed to expand welfare programmes, including bringing all Indians above the age of 70 under an existing free health insurance programme and pushing piped cooking gas connections to all houses to follow up on a subsidised cooking gas cylinder programme launched in 2016.\n\nOther promises include raising the cap on loans for non-farming small and micro borrowers, offering free housing for another 30 million poor and keeping up a free grains programme for 800 million Indians until 2029.\n\nThe manifesto said the BJP government would continue to focus on a path of low inflation and fiscal prudence to achieve high economic growth.\n\n""The ambition of the 1.4 billion people of the country is Modi\'s mission,"" Modi said. ""I am placing this manifesto before the people to seek their blessings. Please bless us ... to increase our strength ... implement this manifesto and ensure a developed India.""\n\nUnemployment was the primary concern of 27% of the 10,000 voters surveyed by Lokniti-CSDS across 19 of India\'s 28 states, with rising prices coming second at 23%, the Hindu newspaper reported last week.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 5.4% in 2022/23, from 4.9% in 2013/14 just before Modi swept to power, and nearly 16% of urban youth in the 15-29 years age group remained unemployed in 2022/23 due to poor skills and a lack of quality jobs, official data shows.

139,139,"b""NEW DELHI (AP) -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday vowed to boost social spending, develop infrastructure and make India into a global manufacturing hub as companies shift away from China, as he unveiled his Hindu nationalist party's election strategy.\n\nModi hopes to return to power for a third five-year term. He and other leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party unveiled their promises in the world's largest democracy days before the start of a multi-phase general election.\n\nModi promised to expand social programs introduced during his party's 10-year rule, including millions of free homes for the poor, along with health care, cooking gas and free grain. His government has been paying 6,000 rupees ($73) a year to poor farmers.\n\nHe said his government's policies have pulled 250 million people out of poverty since he came to power in 2014. India is the world's most populous country with over 1.4 billion people. The BJP's president, J.P. Nadda, said less than 1% of Indian people now live in extreme poverty.\n\nIndia holds its elections on different days in different parts of the country, stretching over weeks. Voting for the country's parliament will begin on April 19 and run until June 1, and results will be announced on June 4.\n\nMost polls have predicted a victory for Modi and the BJP. But the opposition Congress Party argues that Modi has undermined India's democracy and favored the interests of the rich.\n\nModi has been campaigning extensively across the country, promising to expand India's economy to $5 trillion by 2027 from around $3.7 trillion. He also promises to put India on track to become a developed country by 2047, when the country celebrates 100 years of independence from British colonialists.\n\nOn Sunday, he said his party would develop India as a hub for the pharmaceutical, energy, semiconductor and tourism industries. He also said India will modernize its infrastructure, including its railways, airways, and waterways. And he said he will seek to increase jobs for young people and access to cheap loans for young entrepreneurs.\n\nModi is broadly popular in India, where he's considered a champion of the country's Hindu majority and has overseen rapid economic growth.\n\nBut critics say another term for the BJP could undermine India's status as a secular, democratic nation, saying its 10 years in power have brought attacks by Hindu nationalists against the country's minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,140,"b'(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk postponed his visit to India which would have included a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he has to deal with ""very heavy"" obligations at Tesla Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\n""Unfortunately, very heavy Tesla obligations require that the visit to India be delayed, but I do very much look forward to visiting later this year,"" the billionaire said in a post on X. He had been scheduled to visit for two days -- April 21 and 22 -- to announce plans to enter the Indian market.\n\nThe decision to postpone comes after a hectic week at Tesla. Early Sunday, Musk announced in a memo to the company\'s more than 140,000 employees that he was reducing headcount by more than 10% globally. Two top executives also departed.\n\nOn Wednesday, the company said it will ask shareholders to vote again on a $56 billion compensation package for Musk that was voided by a Delaware court in January. And on Friday, it recalled almost 3,900 of its futuristic Cybertruck pickups to fix or replace accelerator pedals that can dislodge and cause the vehicle to unintentionally accelerate, increasing risk of a crash, and cut the price of most of its cars in the US by $2,000 as sales slow and inventories rise.\n\nThe company will also report first-quarter earnings Tuesday, having already said deliveries in the first three months of the year missed estimates by a wide margin. The stock has fallen more than 40% this year, slicing the automaker\'s market value to less than $470 billion.\n\nMusk\'s planned India visit was critical in terms of timing for both him and Modi. India has kicked off voting for its national elections where Modi is seeking a third term citing the nation\'s economic rise. Investments from billionaires like Musk will burnish his appeal among voters.\n\nMusk is seeking permission for SpaceX\'s Starlink Inc. to operate in what will be by far its biggest market. Starlink has already received assurances from India\'s government that it will be able to start operating in the country as soon as the third quarter of this year, Bloomberg reported earlier.\n\nTesla has also been trying to break into India for years but high import taxes were a deterrent, something Musk has pointed out repeatedly. India last month lowered import taxes on EVs from foreign carmakers that pledge to invest at least 41.5 billion rupees ($497 million) and start EV production from a local factory within three years.\n\nA sizable investment by Tesla, on the other hand, would allow Musk to tap India\'s booming electric vehicle market and counter slowing demand for EVs elsewhere. Tesla watchers, however, would want to see action on the ground after witnessing delays in previously announced projects such as the massive Mexico plant.\n\n--With assistance from Dana Hull and Bruce Einhorn.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

142,142,"b'(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk was in dire need of a quick win for Tesla Inc. If that meant flying to China a week after standing up Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then so be it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe billionaire\'s surprise trip to Beijing on Sunday for meetings with officials including Premier Li Qiang paid immediate dividends. Tesla secured tentative approval to deploy its more advanced driver-assistance features in China, potentially boosting revenue in its second-most important market.\n\nTesla\'s China business could use the lift -- the company has repeatedly cut prices over the last 18 months to levels that may have completely wiped out earnings from the country. The company\'s shares soared as much as 14% before the start of regular trading Monday, extending a post-earnings rally.\n\nThe timing suits China, too. The government has been trying to persuade foreign investors that its economy is still open for business, despite government crackdowns and a deflationary crisis. One of the countries it\'s been losing out to amid all the upheaval happens to be India, whose leaders Musk left hanging just over a week ago, citing pressing issues for Tesla.\n\nMusk\'s trip is ""part of the bigger picture of the government in Beijing and local governments wanting to be more open to foreign investment,"" said You Chuanman, head of the Chinese University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen\'s IIA Centre for Regulation and Global Governance.\n\nFor the government, there\'s the added bonus of being seen as welcoming to a prominent US business just after President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that forces TikTok\'s parent company to sell its stake or be banned from app stores. ""That could be considered a signal from Beijing of how different it is for the Chinese government side to accept or welcome foreign investors, while in the US it is the opposite,"" You said.\n\nRed Carpet\n\nMusk\'s visit was in some ways a return to a safe haven.\n\nTesla holds a unique position among China\'s most-favored foreign companies. It was the first international carmaker to operate without having to form a joint venture with a local manufacturer -- an exception not granted to the likes of Volkswagen AG or General Motors Co. The approval for this arrangement was facilitated by Li, the former party chief of Shanghai who is now China\'s No. 2 official.\n\nRead More: Musk Loves China, and China Loves Him Back -- for Now\n\nThat red-carpet treatment contrasts with Tesla\'s long-standing impasse with India, whose trade and tax policies have been unwelcoming to foreign carmakers. Musk said in 2022 that Tesla wouldn\'t set up manufacturing plants in countries where the company isn\'t allowed to first sell and service vehicles.\n\nTesla\'s ties to India showed signs of strengthening in recent months, with expectations building that Tesla may commit about $2 billion to an EV plant, and the government lowering import taxes on vehicles from foreign carmakers that pledge to invest in local manufacturing.\n\nBut any such announcement has been put off. Musk scrapped his visit to India a day before he was supposed to land, just as India\'s elections were getting underway. The nation\'s economic rise is core to Modi\'s campaign for a third term.\n\nThe trip to Beijing drew the ire of some prominent users of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk took over in 2022. Television anchor Sumanth Raman questioned why urgent work at Tesla kept Musk from visiting India, but didn\'t stop him from traveling to China.\n\nMusk\'s postponed India trip may reflect a change in strategy. The CEO announced last week that Tesla was accelerating new models that the company will produce on the same manufacturing lines as its current lineup. Analysts have speculated this could mean the carmaker will further delay construction of a new factory in Mexico, not to mention a plant in India.\n\n\'Nice-to-Have\'\n\nForeign automakers have had trouble finding long-term success in the world\'s most populous nation. Ford Motor Co. said in 2022 that it was exploring alternatives for its manufacturing facilities in India, a year after announcing it would cease making cars in the country. Toyota Motor Corp. said in 2020 that it wouldn\'t expand further due to high tariffs, though it\'s since announced plans to make some EV components in the country.\n\nIndian officials are hopeful that Musk will invest in the near future due to recent changes to EV policies, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.\n\nUltimately, Musk\'s decision to visit China underscores the sense of urgency to get Tesla back on track. EVs make up only a fraction of India\'s car market. In China, approval for the system Tesla markets as Full Self-Driving may help the company claw back some of the market share it\'s lost to domestic manufacturers led by BYD Co.\n\n""China is the linchpin to anything Tesla wants to do. China is a must-have market in terms of vehicle sales, and India is a nice-to-have,"" said Tu Le, the managing director of consultancy Sino Auto Insights. ""Bottom line: Tesla cannot achieve any of its ambitious future goals without continuing to be successful in the China market.""\n\n--With assistance from Bhuma Shrivastava, Advait Palepu and Craig Trudell.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of momentum has been partly blamed on apathy among party workers believing victory is assured and seems to have prompted Modi to change tack in his campaign speeches to try to fire up the Hindu majority, the party's support base, and get them out to voting stations, political analysts said.

144,144,"b'SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla said on Tuesday that it will use its existing factories to build new and more affordable vehicles as early as late this year, leaving investments in new factories in Mexico and India unlikely in the near term.\n\nThe world\'s top EV maker said it plans to raise production by 50% from 2023 to its current capacity of close to 3 million vehicles before investing in new manufacturing lines.\n\n""This update may result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times,"" the company said.\n\nInvestors cheered the decision not to take the risks of building new models in new factories, with Tesla shares jumping 12% in after-hour trading despite the company\'s quarterly results missing financial targets.\n\n""I think it\'s a positive that he\'s not just barreling ahead with an expansion plan, ignoring the challenges in the market and the fact that he\'s doing a cheaper vehicle from the existing product line,"" said Elliot Johnson, chief investment officer at Evolve ETFs, which manages nearly $6 billion in assets, including investments in Tesla and other EV makers.\n\nReuters exclusively reported on April 5 that Tesla had scrapped plans to launch its cheap vehicle, known as Model 2, which Tesla planned to build in Texas, Mexico and a third country. The Model 2 had been expected to cost $25,000 and drive Tesla\'s growth into a mass-market automaker.\n\nMusk had responded to the Reuters report with a message on X that ""Reuters is lying."" He did not give details and on Tuesday he did not directly address the Reuters report.\n\nInstead, Tesla discussed unidentified new models that appeared to be different products.\n\nIn January, Musk said Tesla aimed to deliver the cheaper new model in the second half of 2025, adding that the model will have ""revolutionary manufacturing technology"" and generate the next wave of growth for Tesla.\n\nBut Lars Moravy, head of Tesla\'s engineering, said on Tuesday that new manufacturing process and production lines come with ""some risks,"" and the automaker made a ""major strategy shift"" to utilize its facilities to build low-cost vehicles in a fast and efficient manner.\n\nMusk had been expected to meet with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and announce major investments in an auto factory to produce a small, affordable model. Musk canceled at the last minute, citing ""very heavy Tesla obligations.""\n\nMusk said last year that Tesla will ""definitely"" build its factory in Mexico, but that the timing of the factory would depend on the economy and interest rates that reduce the affordability of vehicles. He also said that Tesla would start the initial phases of construction last year.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday on its plans in Mexico and India.\n\nSmaller peer Rivian, known for its R1S SUVs and R1T pickup trucks, said last month it would start producing its smaller, less expensive electric R2 SUVs at its existing U.S. factory to hasten deliveries in the first half of 2026. It had previously planned to build the R2 at a new $5 billion plant.\n\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; additional reporting by Abhirup Roy; editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Adler)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It ends on June 1 and votes will be counted on June 4.\n\nOn Friday, in the largest of the seven phases, 166 million voters in 102 constituencies across 21 states and territories will vote, including in Tamil Nadu in the south, Arunachal Pradesh on the Himalayan frontier with China, and the most populous Uttar Pradesh in the north.\n\nVoters began lining up outside polling stations much before they opened at 7:00 a.m. (0130 GMT) amid tight security, including senior citizens who needed help to reach the booths.\n\n""Modi will come back to power, because apart from the religious push, his other work, including on safety and security is good,"" said Abdul Sattar, 32, a Muslim voter in Uttar Pradesh\'s Kairana, about 100 km (60 miles) from Delhi.\n\nMohammed Shabbir, a 60-year-old driver and father of eight, said unemployment was the main issue for him as none of his children have regular jobs.\n\nHindu nationalism is not an issue in this election, ""because even the Hindus are affected by a lack of jobs"", he said.\n\nSurveys suggest BJP will easily win a majority even though voters have serious concerns about unemployment, inflation and rural distress in the world\'s fastest growing major economy, with the spotlight being on whether BJP can improve on its 2019 victory and by how much.\n\n""In the next five years, we will take our nation into the top three economies of the world, launch a final and decisive assault against poverty, open up newer avenues of growth ... unveil the next generation of reforms, and take a number of pro-people decisions and actions,"" Modi wrote in the BJP\'s election manifesto.\n\nThe manifesto and the theme of the BJP campaign is titled ""Modi Ki Guarantee"" or Modi\'s guarantee to fulfill promises made to voters, underlining the unusual leader-centric, presidential-style pitch in a parliamentary system.\n\n""I urge all those voting ... to exercise their franchise in record numbers,"" Modi posted on X, minutes before polling began.\n\n""I particularly call upon the young and first time voters to vote in large numbers.

""Are we not Indian citizens?

It would not take them much.. the prime minister doesn\'t care.""\n\nThe state of 3.6 million people has been ravaged by fighting between the majority Meitei and tribal Kuki-Zo people for about a year, and continues to be divided into two enclaves: a valley controlled by the Meiteis and the Kuki-dominated hills, separated by a stretch of \'no man\'s land\' monitored by federal paramilitary forces.\n\nOpinion polls predict an easy victory for Modi when the election results are announced on June 4, but Manipur, a state governed by his own BJP, represents a rare security failure for him, contrasting with his carefully cultivated strongman image.\n\nModi told a regional newspaper last week that there has been a marked improvement in Manipur\'s situation because the government ""dedicated our best resources and administrative machinery to resolving the conflict"".\n\nBut two Kuki men were killed on Friday in the latest fighting and there is no let-up in the fear pervading the state, residents said.\n\nIn its election manifesto, the opposition Congress party has promised to remove the BJP-led state government, ""heal the wounds between the communities"" and bring ""a political and administrative settlement that will be satisfactory to all the people of the state"".\n\nBut with its two seats, both of which were won by BJP and its ally in 2019, Manipur has little impact on national politics and the 543-seat parliament.

156,156,"b'NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Nearly 1 billion Indians will be eligible to vote in the world\'s biggest election starting this month. Opinion polls predict an easy win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which would give him a record-equalling third straight term.\n\nHere are some of the key issues in the elections to 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament, that will be held in seven phases between April 19 and June 1, with vote counting on June 4.\n\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, INFLATION\n\nIndia\'s economy is expected to have grown by about 8% in the last fiscal year ended March 31, the fastest among major countries.\n\nIn the past decade under Modi, the Indian economy has jumped five places to the fifth position in the world and he has ""guaranteed"" to lift it to third position should he win the election. One of the highlights of the Modi era has been gleaming roads and bridges across the country, including in and around New Delhi and Mumbai, its two major cities.\n\nFruits of the booming economy, however, are more visible in the cities than in the vast countryside. A sharp price rise has also been a concern.\n\nRetail inflation in 2022/23 accelerated to 6.7% from 5.5% in 2021/22, and 6.2% the year ago. Annual retail inflation was 5.09% in February.\n\nWELFARE POLICIES\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has been giving free food rations to 814 million of India\'s 1.42 billion people. Some critics have said the fact that the government feels the need to support nearly 60% of India\'s population with free cereal is a sign of uneven economic growth in the country.\n\nBy the end of last year, India\'s richest citizens owned 40.1% of its wealth, the highest since 1961, and their share of total income was 22.6%, the most since 1922, according to a study by research group the World Inequality Lab.\n\nModi and his BJP have also tried to win over women voters by focusing on their welfare, including through cash handouts and domestic benefits such as piped water, 24/7 electricity and cooking gas connections.\n\nHINDU REAWAKENING\n\nModi in January led the consecration of a grand temple to Hindu God-king Ram on a site believed to be his birthplace, fulfilling a 35-year-old promise of the Hindu-nationalist BJP. A Hindu mob in 1992 pulled down a 16th-century mosque on the site, which many Hindus believe was built over a demolished temple under the Mughal ruler Babur.\n\nThe prime minister\'s regular visits to Hindu temples across the country are widely broadcast on news channels, which political analysts say helps his image of being the champion of the majority community that forms the BJP\'s core support base.\n\nAt the same time, many Muslims have accused the government of effecting policies going against the community\'s interest. The BJP says it works for all but appeases none, in a dig at opposition parties that have traditionally won the support of Muslims.\n\nModi\'s government has ended federal support for Muslim schools, or madrasas, and some BJP states have either closed many of them or are on the verge of doing so, despite opposition from Muslim leaders.\n\nModi has also implemented a citizenship law that has been criticised as discriminating against Muslims, granting nationality to Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians who fled to India due to religious persecution from Muslim-majority Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan before Dec. 31, 2014.\n\nCORRUPTION\n\nA government agency that investigates suspected money laundering has summoned, questioned, raided or arrested nearly 150 opposition politicians in the past decade. In the same period, it has investigated only about half a dozen ruling party politicians.\n\nThe highest profile arrest has been that of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, a senior opposition politician who denies any corruption. Modi says agencies are free to investigate anyone as per his ""zero-tolerance"" policy on corruption.\n\nOpposition politicians have accused Modi of misusing government agencies to target them for political gains. The main opposition Congress, meanwhile, is battling tax demands, which it has called an attempt to cripple it before the vote.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT\n\nModi first came to power in 2014 partly on the promise of creating tens of millions of jobs for the country\'s youth but has largely failed to deliver.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 8% in February, according to the privately held Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. According to government estimates, the unemployment rate rose to 5.4% in the fiscal year ended March 2023, from 4.9% in 2013/14 before Modi took over.\n\nNearly 16% of urban youth in the 15-29 age group remained unemployed in 2022/23 due to poor skills and lack of quality jobs, government data shows. Estimates by private agencies are much higher.\n\nFARMERS\n\nThe BJP had promised to double farm income by 2022 in its manifesto for the last election, but there is no sign of that.\n\nProtesting farmers, especially from the northern state of Punjab, forced Modi in 2021 to roll back three farm reform laws, a rare policy reversal by him. This year, the farmers hit the streets again demanding higher guaranteed prices for their produce, though the protests fizzled out within weeks.\n\nGLOBAL STATURE\n\nThe BJP often highlights India\'s rising global stature, backed by its economy, as a key achievement of Modi, especially after hosting the G20 summit last year and successfully evacuating its citizens stuck in Ukraine after Russia\'s attack.\n\n(Reporting by Krishna N.

160,160,"b'NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is holding the world\'s biggest election starting this month, with nearly 1 billion people eligible to vote and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the pole position.\n\nWHAT IS IT?\n\nElections to the 543 contested seats in the lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha, for a term of five years. To rule, a party or a coalition needs a simple majority of 272 seats. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 303 seats the last time, followed by 52 for the main opposition Indian National Congress (INC).\n\nIn addition to the contested seats, India\'s president can nominate up to two Anglo-Indians to the Lok Sabha.\n\nWHERE AND WHEN IS IT TAKING PLACE?\n\nThe elections will be conducted in seven phases partly to ensure sufficient security at polling booths across the vast country. Voters can make their choice by pressing a button on an electronic voting machine, first used in India in 1982 and more widely since the early 2000s.\n\nVotes will be counted on June 4 after polling is done on April 19, April 26, May 7, May 13, May 20, May 25 and June 1.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nThe world\'s most populous nation follows the first-past-the-post system, where voters cast a vote for a single candidate in a constituency and the candidate with the most votes wins the seat. The voting age is 18 years and contestants need to be at least 25 years old.\n\nA total of 968 million voters are registered, out of which 497 million are men and 471 million are women. A higher percentage of women voters than men are likely to vote for the second time in a row.\n\nWHO ARE THE MAIN CANDIDATES?\n\nModi headlines the race, followed by his de facto deputy Amit Shah and the main opposition face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. Gandhi\'s mother Sonia, the matriarch of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, is not contesting this time.\n\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT?\n\nModi is chasing a record-equalling third straight term like India\'s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Modi says another overwhelming victory for the National Democratic Alliance, led by the BJP, is crucial to meet his goal of lifting India to a developed economy by 2047 from middle-income levels. The world\'s fifth-largest economy has grown fast in the past few years and Modi has ""guaranteed"" to take it to the third position if he wins the election.\n\nThe BJP draws its support mainly from Hindus, who form 80% of the country\'s 1.42 billion people and for whom Modi earlier this year delivered on a key party promise of building a grand Hindu temple on a disputed site.\n\nThe opposition ""INDIA"" alliance, largely a centre-left grouping of more than two dozen disparate parties, says a victory for it is essential to save the country\'s democratic and secular setup, lift its marginalised communities, raise prices for farmers and create jobs for its young. Opinion polls, which have a mixed record in India, predict another thrashing of the Congress alliance at the hands of the BJP.\n\n(Reporting by Krishna N.

Markam asked.\n\nThis year it was different: Tetam was one of more than 100 villages in former rebel-held territories where a national vote was staged for the first time since independence from British rule in 1947.\n\n- \'The state has arrived\' -\n\nThe Naxalite rebellion, as the Maoist movement is known, began in the 1960s as a revolt against the exploitation of marginalised rural Indians.\n\nMore than 10,000 people have died in the insurgency, waged in the name of the poor and largely tribal communities where the rebels are based.\n\nHeavy-handed campaigns against the guerrillas have often backfired in the past by bolstering hostility towards the government.\n\nBut the Naxals also have a track record of abductions, forced recruitment, demands for protection money and summary executions that have struck fear into those living alongside the rebels in their heartland.\n\nAt the peak of the insurgency, the Red Corridor was a vast swathe of territory controlled by rebels that rejected the Indian state, operating their own parallel health clinics, schools and criminal justice system.\n\n""Earlier, the rebels used to ask the villagers if they\'d seen any other government,"" a top interior ministry official in New Delhi told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n""\'We are your doctors, teachers, and judges,\' they said. And they were right. But not anymore. They negated the state. But the state has finally arrived.""\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\'s government has pumped billions to construct new roads and mobile towers in the region in the last few years.\n\nAlong with reinvigorated counterinsurgency operations, the number of districts with an active Maoist presence has nearly halved to 45 since 2010, according to an official report last year.\n\n""The government and security forces reaching these regions simultaneously is the antidote, and not just a singular focus on security,"" the interior ministry official said.\n\n""We are the two tracks of a train, and we have to run with each other to reach the destination.""\n\n- \'So much to see\' -\n\nAround 80 Maoist rebels have been killed since January, including a group of 29 killed in a government assault in a remote area of Chhattisgarh three days before India\'s election began.\n\nHome minister Amit Shah this week said the government was running a ""focused campaign to root out"" the insurgents, with 250 security garrisons established in the state since 2019.\n\nOne such garrison was established near Tetam in 2022 as a paved road was being laid to the village for the first time.\n\nLife in the village remains hardscrabble and reliant on foraging from the surrounding forests for survival, but evidence of a budding transformation is everywhere.\n\nIn the last 18 months, Tetam\'s inhabitants now have mobile connections, power from the national grid, a health clinic and a government ration shop.\n\nLong kept isolated as the insurgency raged around them, some of Tetam\'s 1,050 inhabitants have since ventured out of their home community for the first time.\n\nMany have gone to visit the nearest small town of Dantewada -- population around 20,000, according to local officials -- for the first time.\n\n""The city was really wonderful,"" Tetam resident Deepak Markam, 27, told AFP.\n\n""There was so much to see there. I hope our village also develops to be like it.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
162,162,"b'(Reuters) - India has been using electronic voting machines (EVMs)extensively since 2000 to record votes in the world\'s largest election.\n\nThis year, voting in the seven-phase election begins on April 19 and votes will be counted on June 4. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely expected to win a third straight term.\n\nHere are some details about the EVMs, which have drawn criticism that they are vulnerable to tampering:\n\nWHAT IS THE EVM?\n\nIncludes a thick, rectangular device used to electronically record votes cast in elections. Voters need to press one of the blue buttons placed against the serial number, name and symbol of the candidate of their choice, apart from the option of ""none of the above"".\n\nAn EVM has three units - a ballot unit, a control unit for the officer-in-charge to ensure a voter is able to vote only once, and a voter-verifiable-paper-audit-trail (VVPAT) unit, which produces a paper slip that is visible to the voter via a transparent screen for about seven seconds before it gets stored in a sealed drop box.\n\nThe control unit is placed next to the officer-in-charge while the other two units are kept in a voting compartment for voters to make their choice privately.\n\nThe whole setup is without any wired or wireless connectivity outside the system.\n\nHOW MANY VOTES AND CANDIDATES?\n\nEach ballot unit can include 16 candidate options including ""none of the above"". A total of 24 such units can be connected to a control unit, which means that one unit can cater up to 384 candidates, should there be so many candidates from one seat.\n\nAn EVM system, which can record up to 2,000 votes, runs on battery or power-packs supplied by its makers, government-run Bharat Electronics and Electronics Corp of India.\n\nThe whole setup costs nearly 34,000 rupees ($408) and can work for about 15 years.\n\nWHEN WAS IT FIRST USED?\n\nEVMs were first used in India for a by-election to the Parur assembly seat of the southern state of Kerala in 1982. It was deployed widely in the country from 2000.\n\nSeveral other countries have tried such machines in limited ways.\n\nWHY EVMs?\n\nThe Election Commission says EVMs help overcome issues like invalid votes due to improper marking or ink smudging in paper ballots and stuffing of ballot boxes with spurious votes or pre-marked ballot papers. It also says that manual counting of ballots is ""prone to errors and mischief and takes a lot of days"".\n\nAn EVM does not allow more than four votes per minute, which the Commission says makes it difficult for any party to capture a booth momentarily to inflate their numbers without drawing the attention of security forces.\n\nIf an EVM goes out of order during polling, then the full set is replaced in the presence of polling agents appointed by candidates. The Commission says the votes recorded until then remain safe in the memory of the control unit and the VVPAT unit.\n\nWHAT IS THE CONTROVERSY?\n\nThe Election Commission says the paper slips, which were introduced in the Noksen assembly constituency of the northeastern state of Nagaland in 2013, can be used to verify the electronic vote count in case of a dispute. Opposition parties say all paper slips should be counted separately to rule out hacking of the machines or any other manipulation.\n\nThe Commission says ""there is no question of EVMs being programmed several times, or manipulated by connecting to a cellphone, Bluetooth devices, replacing part of it or through any other form of manipulation"".\n\nIndian courts have largely endorsed EVMs.\n\n(Reporting by Krishna N.

The country has more than 2,500 political parties but just 10 of them hold 86% of all seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament.\n\nA serious contest between a few parties will likely be dominated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nBHARATIYA JANATA PARTY (BJP)\n\nThe BJP, the world\'s largest political outfit with nearly 180 million members, was born out of the Jan Sangh party, an offshoot of a men-only Hindu nationalist organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). After struggling on the political margins early after it was formed in 1980, the BJP delivered its first prime minister 16 years later in an unstable government that lasted 13 days.\n\nThe party formed a government with a majority of its own for the first time in 2014 under Modi. It\'s been formidably in power since.\n\nNarendra Modi: Modi, 73, was born and raised in a small town in the western state of Gujarat. He joined the BJP\'s ideological parent, the RSS, in his 20s and the Jan Sangh nearly a decade and a half later.\n\nHe\'s risen through the ranks over years and was Gujarat\'s chief minister for more than three terms before leading the BJP into a decisive victory in the 2014 general election. A decade in power, Modi remains enduringly popular as he seeks a record-equalling third straight term. Pollsters predict an easy win for him and the BJP, powered by consistent wooing of the Hindu majority, strong economic growth and handouts.\n\nModi is seeking to be re-elected from Varanasi, a city of religious significance to Hindus in the populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAmit Shah: A close Modi aide, Shah is India\'s home affairs minister - a position critical to matters of national security. He became the president of the ruling BJP in 2014 after Modi stormed to power and took up a cabinet position in Modi\'s second term in 2019.\n\nShah is credited with helping shepherd Modi\'s Hindu-first agenda such as stripping Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir of its special status as a state and implementing a contentious citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims.\n\nShah is seeking to be re-elected from Gujarat\'s Gandhinagar, the capital of the state.\n\nINDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS\n\nThe Congress is India\'s oldest political party and governed India for more than two-thirds of the years since independence in 1947 but has struggled after Modi swept to power.\n\nCongress gave the its first and only woman prime minister, Indira Gandhi, and introduced comprehensive economic reforms in 1991 making way for the evolution of an open market economy.\n\nBut it crashed out of power in 2014 against the Modi onslaught and a series of corruption allegations.\n\nRahul Gandhi: Modi\'s fiercest opponent and Congress\'s star campaigner, Gandhi has never been a minister in a federal or state government, has not led his party to a general election victory, and quit as party chief after a miserable performance at the last parliamentary polls in 2019.\n\nYet he remains at the centre of India\'s opposition politics and Modi\'s main target. His father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all prime ministers and led the country for more than 37 years.\n\nGandhi, 53, is a four-time parliament member who has struggled to mobilise masses to support a wobbly 26-member opposition alliance he helped stitch together. He set off on two cross-country walks to invigorate his campaign and tap into disenchantment over lack of jobs, income inequality and rural distress.\n\nGandhi is fighting this election from Wayanad in the southern state of Kerala. The matriarch of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, Sonia Gandhi, has decided to not contest in this year\'s election.\n\nAAM AADMI PARTY (AAP)\n\nThe Aam Aadmi or Common Person\'s Party emerged from a strong anti-corruption movement in 2011 that swelled amid protests led by Anna Hazare - a self-styled crusader backed by close aide Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nKejriwal formed the AAP in 2012 and formed a local government in the national capital Delhi in 2015, staging an unexpected political upset for established parties like the BJP and Congress. Kejriwal, who has been Delhi\'s chief minister since, is a staunch Modi critic and a Congress ally in the upcoming elections.\n\nHowever, AAP\'s prospects are clouded by pre-election arrests of most of its high-profile leaders, including Kejriwal, in an alleged graft case.\n\nThe party that also runs Punjab state dismisses the allegations as ""a desperate attempt to malign the image"" of Kejriwal.\n\nDRAVIDA MUNNETRA KAZHAGAM (DMK)\n\nA strong regional force in India\'s south, the DMK is India\'s third-largest party in terms of the number of seats it holds in the lower house of parliament. A Congress ally, DMK also runs Tamil Nadu state, where the poverty rate is 2%, one of the lowest in the nation, and boasts a high literacy rate.\n\nALL INDIA TRINAMOOL CONGRESS (TMC)\n\nIndia\'s fourth-largest party by seats in parliament, the Trinamool Congress holds power in West Bengal in the east, another state the BJP has struggled to crack. The party came into being nearly 25 years ago after it splintered from the Congress.\n\nFounder of the party Mamata Banerjee has been the state head for nearly 13 years and is now a reluctant Congress ally in fighting the BJP in the 2024 polls. Her party has joined the 26-member opposition bloc but failed to clinch an agreement over who will fight from which seat in the state.\n\nOne of the TMC candidates for the election is Mahua Moitra, a persistent critic of Modi.

Its slogan before this year\'s election began was ""Ab ki baar, 400 paar"" or ""This time, above 400"".\n\nMore than half a dozen BJP leaders and political analysts that Reuters spoke to said a lack of momentum in the two initial phases of the seven-phase election have dampened hopes of a huge majority for the party, although they said it was still likely to retain power in the world\'s most populous nation.\n\nWhat could be affected is the BJP\'s aim to get a two-thirds majority in the chamber, or 362 seats, which would let the party usher in far-reaching constitutional changes.\n\n""The fall in polling turnout is mainly due to apathy among party workers and voters,"" said Sanjay Sharma, one of the members of the BJP\'s campaign committee in the northern state of Haryana.\n\nSome candidates were being affected by an anti-incumbency wave, he said, adding the party was facing a ""tough fight"" in the state where it won all ten parliamentary seats in 2019.\n\nModi himself has shifted in his campaign speeches from a focus on the administration\'s successes in his 10-year tenure to targeting minority Muslims and the opposition Congress party.\n\n""After the first phase, we saw a definite change of strategy by the PM...delivering Islamophobic kind of speeches,"" said Arati Jerath, a Delhi-based political commentator.\n\n""Obviously, he has now decided to polarise the campaign.""\n\nA total of 190 seats went to the polls on April 19 and 27 with approximate voter turnout at about 66%, the Election Commission has said. The number was only slightly lower than the last election in 2019, although there was a drop of 5-8 percentage points in voting in the BJP and allied-ruled states Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan.\n\nThe BJP had been hoping for a high turnout, believing that would signal that its supporters had voted in force.\n\nPolling ends on June 1 and votes will be counted on June 4. The government bans the publication of exit polls until all voting is concluded.\n\n\'BELOW EXPECTATIONS\'\n\nGopal Krishna Agarwal, BJP\'s national spokesman, said the voting numbers were ""below expectations"" but would not have much impact on the final results.\n\n""Many voters have become lethargic as they are convinced about the victory of the party,"" he said.\n\nThe BJP\'s shift in tack may have backfired with some voters.\n\n""We have lost interest because the BJP is seeking votes by communalising the campaign, and not on its performance,"" said Vikash Kumar, a voter in Rajnandgaon in the state of Chhattisgarh.\n\nKamal Abbas, a Muslim shopkeeper in the city of Lucknow, the capital of politically vital Uttar Pradesh state, reflected the sense of apathy. He said he would not waste time and money to travel to his hometown Prayagraj to vote as Modi\'s party was set to win the election.\n\n""Minority votes do not stand anywhere in the majoritarian government... there is no point in wasting time,"" he said.\n\nAnirudh Singh, one of the district campaign managers of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, said the party would have reaped rich electoral dividends if the election was held during February-March, when fervour over the construction of the Ram Temple was at its peak.\n\n""The party has failed to encash public support for Modi after the inauguration of the temple,"" said Singh, noting that the religious feel-good mood had by and large been replaced by issues like jobs and inflation.\n\n""So far there\'s neither a communal wave, nor a Ram wave, nor a Modi wave in the election,"" said Jerath, the political commentator, noting Modi would have to re-invigorate his party workers and supporters if he hoped for a sweep.\n\nAfter being battered by Modi in the two last general elections, opposition parties are hopeful of a better performance.\n\nThe shift in the language and style of Modi\'s campaign reflected a sense of nervousness, said Jairam Ramesh, a Congress party general secretary.\n\n""The initial voting trends show there is no Modi wave. In states where we were wiped out in 2019, this time the trends are encouraging,"" he said.\n\nGilles Verniers, a political analyst who teaches at Amherst College in Massachusetts, said the BJP appeared to have revised its expectations and was feeling a bit rattled at the moment.\n\n""But it\'s still a very long campaign. There\'s still room for events and surprises that may alter the course of the election,"" he said.\n\n""The balance of probability continues to tilt in favour of the BJP, but not maybe as strongly as they would have hoped.""\n\n(Additional reporting by Jatindra Dash in BHUBANESWAR, Saurabh Sharma in LUCKNOW; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also said parties had been directed to remove such content within three hours of it being brought to their notice.\n\nModi, the face of the Hindu-nationalist BJP, seeking a rare third consecutive term, had focused his campaign largely on his government\'s performance on economic growth and welfare benefits.\n\nBut he changed tack after the first phase of voting on April 19 and his campaign speeches have since become more polarising on religious lines, accusing Congress of planning to redistribute the wealth of the majority Hindus among minority Muslims, who he called ""infiltrators"" who have ""more children"".\n\nThe videos shared by the BJP over the last ten days, one of which has since been taken down, illustrated the same message.\n\nA 17-second video shared by a state unit of BJP on May 4, with over 8.5 million views, shows a character resembling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi feeding ""funds"" to a bird in a skullcap, which eventually pushes out from their common nest three other birds representing other disadvantaged groups.\n\nThe Congress has filed a police complaint against BJP leaders for the video, BJP\'s head of information and technology Amit Malviya said on X.\n\n""The Congress should in fact thank the BJP for taking their manifesto to the people in a manner that even they couldn\'t,"" he wrote.\n\nThe video has elicited outrage. Nitasha Kaul, a politics professor at London\'s Westminster University said on X that the video was a ""straightforward 1930s Germany style cartoon"".\n\nIn its manifesto for the elections, the Congress has promised to tackle India\'s economic inequality by conducting a socio-economic caste census and extending affirmative action. It said it will ensure that minorities receive ""their fair share"" of education, economic and healthcare opportunities.\n\nAn Election Commission spokesperson, the BJP\'s Malviya and Congress spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik, additional reporting by Shivangi Acharya and Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Toby Chopra)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gandhi was speaking at a campaign rally here in support of Congress\' candidate from Solapur, Praniti Shinde, and its ally NCP (SP)\'s Dhairyasheel Mohite Patil who is contesting from the neighbouring Madha Lok Sabha constituency.\n\n""Justice needs to be done. Modi has made India the capital of injustice. He is scared as he knows that the election is slipping out of his hands. Due to the electoral bond theft, he knows he will be in trouble after the elections. This is the reason he is continuously speaking lies. But he can not get away this time,"" the Congress leader said.\n\nPeople have realised that they have to protect democracy and the Constitution, and the prime minister was aware of this, he added. Modi was a ""leader of billionaires"" and not of the poor, Gandhi further claimed. The prime minister states that he belongs to the Other Backward Class, but when the Congress demanded a caste census, he started saying there is no caste in India, and there are only the rich and the poor, the Congress leader said. ""If that is so, why does he call himself an OBC,"" Gandhi asked.\n\nThe 2024 Lok Sabha election is not a routine election, he said, claiming that the BJP wanted to scrap the Constitution. ""Its objective is not just to win elections, but destroy the Constitution. The INDIA alliance will save our democracy and protect the Constitution,"" the Congress leader said.\n\nBJP MPs have said in public that the Constitution will be changed if their party wins another term, and without the Constitution nothing will be left for the poor, farmers and labourers, Gandhi said. The Modi government waived loans of Rs 16 lakh crore of a handful of billionaires, he alleged, adding that this amount could have funded farm loan waiver, or the MNREGA scheme for 24 years.\n\n""Seventy crore population in the country has the same amount of wealth as that held by a handful of billionaires,"" Gandhi claimed. Unemployment was at an all time high because one per cent of the population owns 40 per cent of the wealth in the country, the Congress leader said, adding that if the INDIA bloc is voted to power, it will create ""crores of lakhpatis.""\n\n""The Mahalaxmi scheme (in the Congress manifesto) will provide one lakh rupees every year, which is Rs 8,500 every month, to the women from poor households. Similarly, degree and diploma holders will get the right to apprenticeship in PSUs and other institutions for a year.\n\nDuring that time, they will also get Rs 1 lakh in their bank accounts which amounts to Rs 8,500 per month,"" Gandhi added. Demonetisation and the introduction of GST benefitted only a few billionaires, he claimed.\n\n""Farmers wanted loan waiver and Minimum Support Price from Modi. But we will set up a separate commission for farmers which will recommend when they need a loan waiver, and accordingly, it will be done. Besides, when the INDIA alliance comes to power, farmers\' loans will be waived in the first instance,"" he said. MSP for crops will be legally guaranteed, the Congress leader said. He also reiterated that apart from conducting a caste census, the INDIA alliance would carry out an economic survey to find out who holds how much wealth.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have said we want to conduct a caste census to assess the conditions of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and backward classes so that their situation can be improved, but he made fun of it,"" Kharge said.\n\nIf such a prime minister ruled for five more years, the country will be destroyed, the Congress president said.\n\n""He (Modi) says \'sabka sath, sabka vikas\'. He takes support of everyone but never does their \'vikas\' (development).\n\nHe does their \'satyanash\' (destruction). He implemented demonetisation and did not support anyone during the Covid (epidemic),"" Kharge added.\n\nThose who were given ""injections"" (apparently referring to vaccines) during the COVID-19 epidemic were still facing health problems, and laboratories have reported that heart attack cases increased in India as a result of some defect in the medicine, but the Union government does not have any answer on this issue, Kharge claimed.\n\n""This election is being fought to keep India united and save the Constitution and democracy. Modi and his followers say again and again, give us a 400-plus figure. They are seeking 400-plus seats not for the welfare of the poor, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and backward people....They are seeking it to take away the poor people\'s rights,"" he alleged.\n\nThe Congress veteran also asked why RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had to clarify that they were not going to change the Constitution or end reservations if some BJP leader had not talked about such plans earlier. BJP talks about the poor, but ""increases the income"" of industrialists Adani and Ambani, he claimed.\n\n""He (Modi) compares (himself) with former prime ministers Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Rajiv Gandhi. You do not stand anywhere in their comparison....They gave big factories and PSUs to the country, what did you give?"" he asked.\n\nCongress won freedom for the country, Nehru protected its democracy and Dr B R Ambedkar drafted a good Constitution, Kharge said, adding, ""Modi ji, you are alive and became prime minister because of Congress which saved the Constitution, democracy and helped the poor.

Ramesh criticized Modi for not fulfilling these promises and accused him of making empty commitments.On a day Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigned in Telangana, the Congress on Wednesday asked him to clear his stand on the caste census after he promised a sub-quota for the Madiga caste and wondered if that would be another of his ""jumlas"" (rhetoric). Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh also asked where the promised rail coach factory at Kazipet was and why the prime minister failed to deliver the Bayyaram steel plant.\n\n""Today\'s questions for the PM as he heads to Telangana: Where is the rail coach factory at Kazipet? Why did the PM fail to deliver the Bayyaram Steel Plant and ITIR?

At the same time, the Prime Minister has refused to endorse a socioeconomic caste census, which would actually yield facts about the socioeconomic standing of the Madiga community,"" he said.\n\nThe Congress leader also said in fact, the prime minister has refused to hold even the usual decadal census that was due in 2021 and which would have yielded information on the population of the Scheduled Castes in Telangana.\n\nThe Congress Nyay Patra has committed to such a census nationally, and the Congress government in Telangana has already begun preparations to conduct a state-level census, he claimed.\n\n""Can the Prime Minister clarify his stance on the proposal for a caste census? How does he plan to enable sub-quotas for the Madiga community in its absence,"" Ramesh asked, using the hashtag \'ChuppiTodoPradhanMantriji\'.\n\nRamesh also said after repeated flip-flops in the last 10 years, the BJP has failed to establish a rail coach factory at Kazipet. The BJP had committed to establishing this factory in their 2014 Lok Sabha election manifesto as well as their 2014 Telangana assembly election manifesto, he said.\n\nThe central government then released Rs 40 crore for the project and the Telangana government even allocated 60 acres of land for the same, Ramesh said, adding that two years later, in 2016, the Minister of State for Railways, Manoj Singh, abruptly declared that there was no scope for setting up a coach factory anywhere in the country.\n\nDespite this, a coach factory was set up in Maharashtra a few years later, just before the 2019 assembly elections, he claimed, adding that the prime minister then announced another Rs 20,000 crore electric locomotive plant in Gujarat in 2022.\n\nIn December 2022, he said, the Centre clarified again that no plant would be built in Kazipet but later that month, announced that a coach factory would be set up in Assam.\n\n""Before the Telangana assembly elections last year, the Centre reversed its decision yet again, and the PM laid the foundation stone of a railway wagon overhauling centre in Kazipet. Almost a year later, this plan too has failed to materialise.\n\n""Why have the PM and the BJP repeatedly deceived the people of Telangana? Will a railway plant ever be built in Kazipet,"" the Congress leader asked.\n\nPlans for the Bayyaram Steel Plant and the Hyderabad Information Technology Investment Region (ITIR) have fallen by the wayside during the BJP\'s tenure, he said, adding that the UPA government had promised both of these projects under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act of 2014.\n\nBoth projects would have attracted lakhs of crores of investment to Telangana and created thousands of opportunities for the state\'s youth, Ramesh said.\n\nHe said the ITIR alone was expected to attract Rs 2.19 lakh crore of investments and create direct employment for 15 lakh people. Yet, the BJP did not hesitate to sweep these projects under the rug. CM Revanth Reddy has also pointed out that at the same time as these projects were being scrapped, massive projects like the bullet train and Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) were given to Gujarat, he added.\n\n""Why has the Modi Sarkar so callously neglected development projects in Telangana?

The really poor need to be uplifted but this thought process is so pathetic. It is like saying If we take 4 points from RR and 4 from KKR and SRH and re-distribute it to the bottom 3 teams, they can make the playoffs.""\n\nPrasad\'s remarks come in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s recent allegations against the Congress party, insinuating that their intention to redistribute wealth could have adverse implications for the nation. Modi\'s remarks triggered a backlash from opposition parties.\n\nThe controversy stems from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\'s announcement on April 6 regarding the party\'s plan to conduct a comprehensive financial and institutional survey aimed at assessing wealth distribution across various demographics in the country.\n\nIn response to Modi\'s allegations, Rahul Gandhi clarified that the Congress manifesto did not explicitly mention wealth redistribution. Senior party leader Jairam Ramesh emphasized the party\'s commitment to conducting a comprehensive socio-economic caste census.\n\nModi, however, persisted in his accusations, likening the Congress\'s proposed actions to those of Maoists and alleging that the party sought to seize and redistribute citizens\' assets.\n\nAddressing a public gathering in Aligarh, Modi warned against the purported intentions of the Congress-INDIA alliance, cautioning citizens about potential infringements on their property rights.

241,241,"b'Satna, Madhya Pradesh: After four consecutive terms in the Lok Sabha and a surprise defeat in the November 2023 Madhya Pradesh assembly election, BJP MP from Satna Ganesh Singh is in a tough contest yet again. The Congress has fielded Siddarth Kushwaha ""Dabbu"", the leader who defeated him in the state polls just four months ago, as its candidate, while a Brahmin candidate from the BSP is also likely to wean away some voters.\n\nSingh is among the BJP MPs who were fielded by the party in the Madhya Pradesh assembly election. He lost by 4,041 votes to Kushwaha but has been given the ticket again for the Lok Sabha polls. Both Singh, a Kurmi leader, and Kushwaha are from the backward castes, which have a sizable presence in the constituency.\n\nSatna Lok Sabha also has a substantial Brahmin population and the way it votes can prove decisive in this election. While the BJP is hopeful that the Ayodhya Ram temple issue would sway the Brahmin voters to its side, BSP candidate Narayan Tripathi may play the spoiler. In the 2023 assembly election, the BSP fielded Shiv Ratnakar Chaturvedi, making it a triangular fight. Chaturvedi polled 33,567 votes, which ensured Singh\'s defeat. Narayan Tripathi is in a similar role in the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nSatna Lok Sabha constituency has seven assembly seats - Satna, Chitrakoot, Maihar, Nagod, Raigaon (SC), Amarpatan and Rampur-Baghelan. Of these, the Congress had won Satna and Amarpatan in the 2023 assembly polls. The MLAs from Chitrakoot (Nilanshu Chaturvedi) and Maihar (Srikant Chaturvedi) are Brahmins while three seats - Nagod (Nagendra Singh), Rampur-Baghelan (Vikram Singh) and Amarpatan (Rajendra Singh Baghel) are represented by Thakurs.\n\nLocals said the BJP MLAs have not yet come out openly in support of Ganesh Singh. Rajput, primarily Parihar, and Baghel votes are important not so much numerically, as their strength is only about 50,000, but they are influential. Both sides are wooing this community.\n\nGanesh Singh has been representing Satna in the lower house of Parliament since 2004. In 2009, he had defeated Siddarth Kushwaha\'s father Sukhlal who contested on a BSP ticket, but the victory margin was only 4,000-odd votes, a very thin majority for a general election. Sukhlal was a prominent leader of the region, who had defeated former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Arjun Singh from Satna Lok Sabha seat in 1996.\n\nSiddarth Kushwaha is banking on his own work and the legacy of his father in this election. Sukhlal, who reportedly shot himself in 2015, had Dalit support from his BSP days and some of it is likely to come to Siddarth. Kushwaha and Kurmi voters are almost equal and both the Congress and BJP candidates are expected to get the support of the two communities respectively.\n\nKushwaha has been campaigning aggressively on the promises made in the Congress manifesto such as legal status to minimum support price paid by the government for farm produce on Swaminathan Commission\'s recommendation, caste census, Rs 400 per day as minimum wages, Rs 1 lakh per year to poor women and employment to every educated youth.\n\nLocal issues are dominant in the political discourse this time in Satna. Usha Chaudhary, a BSP leader who had switched to the BJP recently, faced the ire of the voters in Raigaon assembly segment when she went to canvas for the BJP in the ongoing election. In a video that has gone viral on social media, voters asked her to leave as she had joined the BJP.\n\nOnly a section of the voters - mostly Brahmins, though they are divided - said they are influenced by the Ram temple consecration.\n\nNarayan Tripathi, who has represented Maihar seat in the Madhya Pradesh assembly four times in the past, started his political journey with the Samajwadi Party, moved to the Congress and then to the BJP. He had won the 2018 assembly polls on a BJP ticket but was expelled later for anti-party activities. In the 2023 assembly election, the BJP fielded Srikant Chaturvedi from Maihar while Tripathi launched the Vindhya Janata Party, which flopped miserably. Tripathi fielded candidates on 25 seats. He and all his candidates lost.\n\nWhile Tripathi is likely to stand third, he can hurt the BJP by splitting the Brahmin votes. Since he had rebelled in the BJP just months ago, he might wean away a section of other voters too. The outcome of the Lok Sabha polls in Satna will depend on which way a big chunk of the 250,000 Brahmin voters swing and how much damage control Ganesh Singh has been able to do since his defeat in the 2023 assembly polls.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has repeated these accusations at subsequent rallies, claiming that a Congress government would investigate individuals\' earnings and property and redistribute them.\n\n""Earlier, when their (Congress) government was in power, they had said that Muslims have the first right on the country\'s assets.

243,243,"b'Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\'s promise of wealth redistribution has kicked up a huge controversy. While the idea itself has been controversial -- right from the bloody revolutions of the past century that promised the poor the wealth amassed by the rich to contemporary debates in economics on how to address inequality and poverty -- a comment on Rahul\'s plan by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought the issue to the headlines. PM Modi alleged on Sunday that ""Congress wanted to confiscate people\'s wealth and redistribute it to Muslims"".\n\nYesterday, adding that opposition parties had done nothing for Muslims, he reiterated his allegations, saying that the Congress was ""looking to survey earnings and wealth of people, including their vehicles, property, and houses to redistribute it in line with a communist ideology that INDIA wanted to implement in the country"".\n\nWhat did Rahul Gandhi say\n\nRahul on Saturday said the Congress, if voted into office in the Lok Sabha elections, would conduct a financial and institutional survey to ascertain who is in possession of the wealth of the country, and would then undertake an exercise to redistribute the same. He also promised representation of each community in every sector.\n\nReleasing the party\'s poll manifesto at a public meeting in Tukkuguda near Hyderabad, he stressed on ""jitni aabadi, utna haq"" principle. ""First, we will conduct a caste census...to know the exact population and status of backward castes, SCs, STs, minorities and other castes. After that, the financial and institutional survey will begin. Subsequently, we will take up the historic assignment to distribute the wealth of India, jobs and other welfare schemes to these sections based on their population,"" he said.\n\nWhile Rahul Gandhi\'s plan sounds like a simple \'Robin Hood\' scheme to rob the rich and pay the poor, an extensive debate has been going on for some time on the idea of wealth redistribution. In old times, the idea was central to communist revolutions but in recent times economists have argued on wealth distribution due to rising income inequality. Though a basic redistributive principle is already inherent in government policies such as progressive taxation in which the rich pay more tax or subsidies and freebies for the poor such as free foodgrains, there has been a demand for radical steps. The basis of current debate on wealth redistribution is an economic study that came just when Rahul\'s comments came.\n\nThe rising inequality and the need for a supertax on the rich\n\nIndia\'s inequality gap has widened sharply under PM Modi\'s decade in power, with the richest 1% of the population now owning 40% of the country\'s wealth, as per a recent study done by several economist including globally renowned Thomas Piketty, who had also helped Rahul frame his idea of minimum income guarantee in 2019.\n\nThe inequality gap widened after the economy\'s opening up in the early 1990s, but ""between 2014-15 and 2022-23, the rise of topend inequality has been particularly pronounced in terms of wealth concentration"", the economists said in the report titled \'Income and Wealth Inequality in India: The Rise of The Billionaire Raj\', and published by The World Inequality Lab. ""In the post-liberalisation years of high growth and rising inequality, the middle class (middle 40%) appears to have lost out significantly,"" the researchers said.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1981, the middle class and richest 10% had nearly identical share in wealth. But over the next three decades, the share of the top 10% pulled ahead while the middle 40% consistently fell to reach 31% by 2012 to 29% by 2023.\n\nBased on figures from the World Inequality Database, India\'s income inequality is among the very highest in the world, behind only Peru, Yemen and a few other small countries, the authors said.\n\nHowever, the trend in India is in line with the experience of other major economies. The study shows that between 1980 and 2014, income of top 0.1 per cent income earners in France and China rose six times faster than the income of bottom 50 per cent. In India, the growth rate of top 1 per cent was 13 times higher, while it was nearly 77 times higher in the US.\n\nThe inequality gap will likely not close on its own without policy intervention, the researchers said, suggesting imposing a ""super tax on Indian billionaires and multimillionaires, along with restructuring the tax schedule to include both income and wealth"".\n\nIn 2022, an Oxfam India study said Indian billionaires saw their combined fortunes more than double during the Covid-19 pandemic, and their count shot up by 39 per cent to 142. It said if the wealth of the first 100 billionaires is accumulated, they could fund the National Rural Livelihood Mission scheme, responsible for creating Self Help Groups for women, for the next 365 years. It said a 4 per cent tax on the wealth of the 98 billionaires would be enough to fund the Mission POSHAN 2.0, which includes Anganwadi Services, POSHAN Abhiyan, Scheme for Adolescent Girls, and National Creche Scheme, for 10 years.\n\nWhat the critics say\n\nWriting in ET, Bibek Debroy, Chairman, Economic Advisory Council to Prime Minister, and the Council\'s assistant consultant Aditya Sinha argue that inequality is a relative measure, and it is not a concern if it coincides with improvement in people\'s lives. Responding to the above-mentioned report, they write, ""Econ 101 teaches us that as an economy grows, so does inequality, a concept illustrated by the Kuznets curve. Living standards of India\'s poorest have improved significantly, a reality underscored by improvements in the Bare Necessities Index and Multidimensional Poverty Index (MDPI). NITI Aayog has shown that 24.82 cr Indians have escaped multidimensional poverty in the last nine years, thanks to schemes such as Jal Jeevan Mission, Swachh Bharat Mission, PMJAY, PMAY or PM Ujjwala.""\n\n""Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek argued that redistributive policies can stifle innovation and productivity. If individuals feel their efforts will be heavily taxed or redistributed, they may not be motivated enough to invest in new ventures or improve productivity, leading to an economic slowdown,"" they write.\n\n""The underlying intent is vilification of those who generate wealth, casting them as adversaries rather than contributors to economic prosperity. The state is bound to address issues of equity. But this doesn\'t mean that the right to private property is challenged in the state\'s attempt to address the problem of inequality,"" they argue.\n\nAtanu Biswas, a professor at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, claims that the World Inequality Lab report is rich in drama and poor in numbers. He says the latest report is based on data their earlier study scored low on transparency. Saying that no estimate is better than ""weird"" estimate, he writes, ""One can wonder how the income distribution was estimated in the first place, given India doesn\'t have any official income surveys. Did they make a lot of assumptions while using auxiliary data?""\n\nWriting on the 2022 World Inequality Lab report by Piketty and his colleagues, which too had asked for high taxes on the rich, columnist Swaminathan S Anklesaria Aiyar had argued that Piketty and his colleagues ignore that the interests of the rich and the poor converge actually. ""Voters are happy to vote for politicians like Joe Biden who propose higher taxes to fund better childcare, health, college education and infrastructure. But these are modest tax measures. They will not reverse rising inequality, which is fuelled above all by fiscal and monetary stimuli to accelerate economic growth,"" he wrote.\n\n""Politicians of all stripes like stimuli because voters do too. But while stimuli raise employment and wages, they increase property and stock market wealth even more. Piketty and Co ignore the extent to which the interests of the poor and rich converge. The rich gain most in booms and lose most in recessions, yet voters prefer booms. Left intellectuals have failed to convince voters of any clear link between soaking the rich and enriching the masses,"" Iyer wrote.\n\nWhat lies ahead?\n\nWhile Rahul\'s radical plan to map everyone\'s assets, including land, cash, jewellery, etc, and then equally divide them among everyone may not sound practical, the \'tax-the-rich\' debate is not going to die down anytime soon in India or the rest of the world. However, heavy taxes on the rich can be highly counter-productive especially for a growing economy like India. Indira Gandhi\'s Garibi Hatao plan included the highest income tax rate of 97.75% and wealth tax of 3.5%, and yet poverty only rose instead of decreasing.\n\nThe governments all over the world face the difficult task of balancing fiscal prudence, welfare spending and economic growth. The Modi government, despite its heavy spending on welfare, thinks India should pay more attention to economic growth as a primary means of decreasing poverty rather than expending more resources on curtailing inequality as redistribution will be better achieved if the size of the pie increases.\n\nThe beginnings of the current \'tax-the-rich\' debate lie in the demand for a basic universal income which had started gaining prominence nearly a decade ago. Rahul too had batted for a basic universal income in the past but the idea of wealth redistribution seems to be an egregious iteration of the sentiment. The Opposition\'s promise of big freebies and welfare measures as well as the Modi government\'s mega schemes such as free foodgrain and a fixed cash transfer to poor farmers, all are the result of increasing demands for higher government spending on the poor.\n\n(With inputs from TOI and agencies)'"

BCs comprise over 50% of the population in Telangana, according to various estimates.\n\nBandi Sanjay Kumar, Eatala Rajender, Dharmapuri Arvind, BB Patil, B Narsaiah Goud, Suresh Kumar Shetkar, T Padma Rao Goud, Nilam Madhu Mudiraj, Kasani Gnaneshwar and G Anil Kumar, who belong to different BC communities, are facing formidable candidates, either from their own communities or other castes.\n\nPolitical observers said though it has been a divided vote bank of BCs over the years in the state, the issue of removing the 50% cap on quota to enhance the reservations for BCs in proportion to their population and conducting a caste census have the potential to make an impact on the electoral prospects of parties and the candidates.\n\nThough caste equations have always played a crucial role in the elections, the 2024 Lok Sabha polls have assumed significance due to the reservation issue and nothing can be said for sure as to which party would be able to garner more BC votes, said the political observers.\n\nA majority of BCs had sailed with BRS in the 2018 assembly polls. Congress had managed to win only 19 seats, while BJP had lost deposits in 100 constituencies. However, the stunning victory of BJP from four Lok Sabha constituencies in 2019, including two BC candidates, and three by Congress (all three Reddys) as against nine by BRS, revealed that the BC vote bank was divided between the three principal parties in various constituencies in the 2019 general election.\n\nIn the 2023 assembly polls, Congress had won 64 seats and could not have done it without the support of BCs, in addition to voters from other communities. This means that a majority of BC voters in rural areas shifted their support from BRS to Congress in the 2023 polls.\n\nFor the May 13 election, BJP MP from Karimnagar Bandi Sanjay is facing two candidates from the influential Velama community in Karimnagar district, V Rajender Rao of Congress and ex-MP B Vinod Kumar of BRS. BJP MP from Nizamabad Dharmapuri Arvind, who defeated K Kavitha of BRS in 2019, is pitted against MLC T Jeevan Reddy of Congress and a BC leader and ex-MLA Bajireddy Goverdhan of BRS.\n\nBJP strongman Eatala Rajender has entered the electoral from India's largest constituency in terms of voters, Malkajgiri.

Nilam Madhu of Congress from Medak, B Narsaiah Goud of BJP from Bhongir, T Padma Rao Goud of BRS in Secunderabad, Kasani Gnaneshwar of BRS in Chevella are all from BC community and face formidable Reddy and other community candidates in their respective constituencies.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
253,253,"b'What did Pitroda say?\n\nHe backed the idea of an inheritance tax and cited the example of the US. ""Nothing wrong in accumulating wealth but to what point? Let me tell you, in America there\'s an inheritance tax. So, if let\'s say one has $100 million worth of wealth, and when he dies he can transfer probably 45% to his children, 55% is grabbed by govt. Now that\'s an interesting law.It says you, in your generation made wealth, and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public - not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair. In India you don\'t have that. If somebody is worth $10 billion and dies his children get $10 billion. The public gets nothing. So these are the kinds of issues that people will have to debate and discuss.""\n\nWhy the controversy?\n\nPitroda\'s comments on inheritance tax come against the backdrop of the Congress manifesto talking about addressing ""growing inequality of wealth and income through suitable changes in policies"" and Rahul Gandhi\'s speeches pushing for economic and institutional surveys, along with caste census. BJP has cited Rahul\'s speeches to claim that the surveys would be a prelude to ""redistribution"" of wealth.\n\nWhat is inheritance tax?\n\nThis is a tax which is levied on property inherited when a person dies. According to Tax Foundation, a think tank on taxation, estate and inheritance taxes are broadly similar because both are generally triggered by death. Estate taxes are levied on the net value of property owned by a deceased person on the date of death. In contrast, inheritance taxes are levied on the recipients of the property, according to the foundation\'s definition.\n\nTackling inequality...\n\nInheritance tax has in some cases been justified to ensure ""equality of opportunity"". An OECD paper says that by breaking down the concentration of wealth and correcting for factors that are beyond the recipients\' control, inheritance and gift taxation can contribute to levelling the playing field across individuals, and thereby increase equality of opportunity and improve social mobility. It cites Thomas Piketty, Saez and Zucman, who have argued that from a meritocratic perspective, inherited wealth should be taxed at higher rates than earned income and self-made wealth. There is an argument against the tax and critics in the US say scrapping it would help raise investments, create jobs and help in expansion of the economy.\n\nWhat is the global scene?\n\nSeveral advanced countries, including the US, UK, Japan, France, and Finland, have inheritance tax ranging from 7% to 55%. Since 2000, 11 countries and two tax jurisdictions have scrapped estate or inheritance tax, according to Tax Foundation data. US prez Joe Biden has backed increasing the inheritance tax rate to 61%.\n\nDid India have inheritance tax?\n\nIndia did have an inheritance tax, and levied a peak rate of 85% estate duty, which was abolished in 1985. Death of a property owner triggered the liability on estate duty. According to tax consulting firm Taxmann, \'property\' was defined in the broadest possible terms and included all movable and immovable assets, interest in expectancy, interest in co-parcenary property (joint heirship), debt or enforceable right, etc. ""The liability on estate duty was cast on the recipient of the estate who was to file a return of estate received based on which the competent authority would complete an assessment. In case an asset was inherited jointly, a joint return was required to be filed,"" according to Taxmann.\n\nSeveral measures to bring social equity have been imposed in the country, including gift tax, wealth tax and estate duty. Wealth tax was scrapped in 2015, while gift tax was withdrawn in 1998 but reintroduced in 2004, levying income tax on gifts to relatives. There was speculation in 2020 that the Union Budget may bring back estate duty. In 2014, the then junior finance minister Jayant Sinha had backed the idea of bringing inheritance tax but it did not move beyond the idea stage.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An apprenticeship right will be given for a year to educated youths having a degree or diploma at PSUs, govt offices and private companies. The youths will then be absorbed, based on their performance,"" the Congress leader said adding, this will be a way to enter the job market and these youths will get Rs 1 lakh a year in their account.\n\nThe poor and jobless face the highest insecurity as they don\'t even get medical facilities, so Congress has decided that govt offices and PSUs will end the contract culture and all the jobs provided will be permanent, the Wayanad MP said.\n\n""Modi ji has waived loans worth Rs 16 lakh crore of 22-25 people. This money belonged to people who worked under MNREGA. But he (PM Modi) can\'t give relief to farmers?

BRS fielded Kasani Gnaneshwar, former MLC and president of Mudiraj Mahasabha, from Chevella while Congress gave ticket to Neelam Madhu from Medak. BJP fielded former minister Eatala Rajender from Malkajgiri.\n\nAccording to Mudiraj leaders, the community voters are the deciding factor in some of the constituencies. For instance, Parigi has highest number of Mudiraj voters in Chevella and BRS gave the ticket to Gnaneshwar from Chevella keeping in view of presence of more BCs, especially Mudirajs, in the constituency. Gnaneshwar is also trying to rope in BC caste organisations in the elections to campaign for him.\n\nSimilarly, Gajwel and Patancheru assembly segments in Medak Lok Sabha seat have more Mudiraj voters. Madhu tried for ticket from BRS and Congress in the 2023 assembly polls from Patancheru but failed. He contested on a BSP ticket. Later, he joined the Congress, which offered him the Medak Lok Sabha ticket. Interestingly, Eatala, who contested from Gajwel on a BJP ticket in the Nov 2023 assembly polls, chose to enter the fray from Gajwel because of huge presence of Mudiraj voters. He, however, lost then.\n\nIn Secunderabad, BCs are more in number and the BRS fielded T Padma Rao, a Goud community leader, while Congress gave the ticket to Danam Nagender, a Kapu leader.\n\nTo get BCs support, Congress passed a resolution on caste census in the state assembly in the budget session. The BRS too pitched for caste census and demanded a separate ministry of OBCs at the Centre and claimed it had given more tickets to BCs in the LS polls.\n\nThe BJP is also trying to woo BCs by claiming that the BJP govt has taken up measures for the welfare of BCs and that PM Narendra Modi himself belongs to BC community.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
258,258,"b'Nagpur/Amravati: In a valiant move to woo farmers, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said if voted to power, his party will establish a commission to grant loan waivers to farmers rather than corporates. Addressing a packed rally at Paratwada (Amravati), he accused PM Modi of catering to ""needs of 25 billionaires"" at the cost of the common man.\n\nRahul Gandhi said ""The rich train their wards in jobs and business through apprenticeship, but poor don\'t get the same facility. Under the new law, we will offer one-year apprenticeship and job guarantee in either public or private sector or government offices. Participants would also receive a stipend of 1 lakh per year. After one year, India will have the best trained workforce in the world.""\n\nTurning his attention to women\'s welfare, the former Congress president outlined the \'mahalaxmi\' scheme, which aims to disburse 1 lakh aid every year to women from poor families directly in their accounts. ""In 21st century, men and women work in MGNREGA and both get wages. The woman works for eight hours there and another eight hours at home for which she doesn\'t get any remuneration. This amount would be offered to her for this work, which is often not recognized. We will also double wages of anganwadi sevikas and Asha workers,"" he said.\n\nTo put money into farmers\' pockets, Gandhi said there will be loan waivers for them ""rather than for corporates"". While promising to establish a permanent commission to recommend loan waivers for farmers as per requirements, Gandhi said ""if loans of billionaires are waived, why not of farmers? We do not have any shortage of money.""\n\nHe said, the Modi-led government was catering to the interests of billionaires, while neglecting the masses. Gandhi said, ""Modi administration has prioritized the needs of 22-25 billionaires whose collective wealth equals that of 70 crore Indians. The govt waived Rs 16 lakh crore in loans of these billionaires, but neglected farmers. Still the PM says he is working for the poor.""\n\nSharing the stage with MPCC president Nana Patole along with Wankhade and Congress candidate from Akola, Dr Abhay Patil, MLA Yashomati Thakur and others, Gandhi said 2024 elections were for protection of democracy and the Constitution, which BJP wanted to change.\n\n""It is the first political party in India which has dared to attack the Constitution along with NDA and RSS. It is the voice of backward classes. The Constitution is not just a book, but it is a weapon. Modi diverts your mind to Pakistan or China and is trying to change the Constitution.""\n\nHighlighting the lack of representation of marginalized communities in media, corporate, and administrative sectors, Gandhi stressed the need for inclusive governance.\n\n""Modi does not want the poor to get acquainted with their rights through the Constitution. He keeps tribal and poor sections of the society away from limelight. Despite being the first tribal President of the country, Draupadi Murmu was kept away from Ram Temple and Parliament building inaugurations. We are now going to do an X-ray of India through the caste census as the first thing when we come to power. We will then conduct an economic survey and every caste will benefit according to its population. This will change the face of India,"" said Gandhi.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
259,259,"b'BENGALURU: Although Lok Sabha elections have concluded in Karnataka, parties have little time to rest since a series of important polls are likely to be scheduled over the next six months.\n\nIn fact, the electoral fervour began with assembly elections in April-May last year and with zilla and taluk panchayats elections and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) polls likely to be scheduled later this year, political functionaries will remain on their toes.\n\nElections to these local bodies are long overdue and were postponed for many reasons, resulting in a packed schedule this year. Zilla and taluk panchayat (ZP-TP) polls -- an exercise that is perhaps matched only by assembly polls since they will be held across 31 districts and encompass an electorate of about 4 crore -- have been pending since May 2021, while BBMP council polls were originally due in September 2020. They were first disrupted by the pandemic and later reorganization of constituencies.\n\n""Successive govts evaded ZP-TP and BBMP polls,"" said Tippeswamy, a senior JD(S) functionary. ""It appears the time has arrived since the current administration cannot avoid its constitutional duty of conducting elections to these local bodies.""\n\nIn Jan, the state govt told the high court that it will fulfil all necessary procedures to conduct these elections within a month. The court was hearing a petition filed by the Karnataka State Election Com mission (SEC).\n\nKey processes involve delimitation of constituencies and notification of constituency-wise reservation. SEC has already compiled electoral rolls, with arrangements underway for a final round of revision.\n\nWhile the delimitation exercise for both ZP-TP constituencies and BBMP wards has been completed, the govt is yet to finalise reservation. In Sept last year, the urban development department reduced BBMP wards from 243 to 225 through a notification. Delimitation for zilla panchayats, comprising 1,101 constituencies, and taluk panchayats (3,621 seats), was carried out in Nov 2023.\n\nQuota conundrum\n\nPriyank Kharge, minister for panchayat raj and rural development, said: ""We are not avoiding ZP-TP polls. They will be conducted soon.""\n\nYet, this determination does not mirror action on the ground in terms of finalising reservation. This, despite the govt accepting the Justice K Bhaktavatsala Commission report, which recommends 33% reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in local bodies. Officials suggest the govt is likely to address this issue in the next cabinet meeting -- when it is also likely to discuss the caste census report submitted by the K Jayaprakash Hegde Commission.\n\n""The state govt has not fulfilled its commitment to the HC regarding reservation. We will petition the court to instruct the govt,"" said S Basavaraj, SEC commissioner.\n\nCouncil polls first up\n\nMeanwhile, in June, Karnataka will also witness elections to 17 seats in the legislative council. These elections have been necessitated due to retirements and resignations of members from various constituencies, including teachers\', graduates\', local bodies, and the legislative assembly.\n\n""Council polls are significant since they can alter party standings. We are confident of securing a majority, as we anticipate winning eight of the 11 seats allocated from the assembly quota,"" said Saleem Ahmed, Congress chief whip in the council. ""We are also optimistic about winning all six seats from teachers\' and graduates\' constituencies.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The party has also said it will provide for a common electoral roll for all levels of polls.\n\nDocument a play on what BJP sees as a \'confident nation\'\n\nThe contrast from Congress and other opposition parties is clear, with BJP refusing to play catch up on the populist track and mentioning fiscal prudence as a mantra for economic management. It has kept its distance from caste census, which is seen by many as a popular theme with the majority of the population. It has also held its own against Congress\'s promise for a legal guarantee for MSP for farm produce, and goes on to talk about incentivising crop diversification.\n\nThe 76-page document, with the imprint of Modi writ large all over it, is a play for what BJP views as a confident nation, with new goals to pursue.\n\nOn the issue of jobs, it has restricted itself to the promise of creation of quality jobs, skilling, promotion of self-employment through expansion of startups, Mudra and Svanidhi schemes and steps to help vendors, transparent recruitment for govt jobs and the assertion that the govt has speeded up filling of vacancies over the last few years.\n\nThe restraint may appear to be a gambit, but seems to reflect an assessment that significant sections have ceased basing their voting preference on freebies offered to them. It also reflects the confidence and self-assuredness that was visible in the bland interim budget earlier this year.\n\nThe party is clearly laying store by Modi\'s track record in fulfilling promises and the manifesto has a full ""mission accomplished"" section -- from Ram Mandir to Article 370.\n\nBut it is not that the party has not tried to reach out to specific sections. The promise to extend Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme to senior citizens of 70 years of all income brackets and seeking to provide essential services at home is one such. The promise of a constituency in Tamil Nadu has led the party to use the manifesto to signal its friendly intent to the state, thus far an indifferent geography amid rising support for the party elsewhere, by a display of reverence for the legendary Thiruvalluvar.\n\nThe party has promised to build upon established vote-spinners like Ujjwala gas connection scheme, free ration and subsidised rural housing. Help has been promised also for women and those looking for homes in urban areas.\n\nOf course, the successes already clocked on the core issues -- Ram Mandir and abrogation of 370 and the promise to score one more, on UCC -- is a reminder to Hindutva adherents to reciprocate the favour.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The arithmetic of electoral politics may have eventually led Congress and BJP to employ strategies that don\'t upset the dominant caste groups\' applecart both nationally and at the state level in these elections, but OBC voters are still being wooed, notwithstanding how fragmented their demographic distribution is.\n\nSeveral months prior to the announcement of polling dates, Congress\' clamour led by Rahul Gandhi and AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge for a nationwide caste census may have come close on the heels of the findings of a similar survey in Bihar becoming public, but action in Karnataka precedes that.\n\nMuch like with \'guarantees\' this season, Karnataka has been at the forefront of the caste census, a report on which a commission headed by Jayaprakash Hegde -- who\'s now the Congress\' candidate from Udupi-Chikmagalur -- has been accepted by the Siddaramaiah government. But he\'s yet to implement its recommendations.\n\nCampaign plots of LS polls in Karnataka include the OCB narrative. If Siddaramaiah, with his Ahinda credentials, is Congress\' lead actor, the BJP is projecting PM Narendra Modi as the OBC face.\n\nShivaraj Thangadagi, backward classes (BC) welfare minister, said, ""Our government has done what none had before by accepting the report. Its implementation will not only benefit backward communities but also the party for sticking to its commitment. Concerns of other communities will be addressed while implementing this.""\n\nUnion home minister Amit Shah and leader of opposition in the assembly R Ashoka have reiterated how BJP was with the OBCs, with Modi being ""Sabse Bada (biggest) OBC"" during their campaigns in Karnataka.\n\nNationally, Nitish Kumar -- who had commissioned the Bihar caste census -- leaving the INDIA bloc and Congress being concerned about caste matrices across states may have seen the grand old party use the OBC card cautiously, but it has included it in its national manifesto, while BJP continues to actively woo these communities.\n\n""Congress didn\'t tolerate leaders from extremely backward classes. In 1987, Congress refused to accept Karpoori Thakur ji as opposition leader, whom we honoured a few days ago with Bharat Ratna. These days, Congress colleagues express concern about the number of people from backward classes in government and where they\'re positioned. But I\'m surprised they don\'t notice the biggest OBC (referring to himself),"" Modi told Parliament on Feb 5.\n\nModi, referring to himself as the biggest OBC, came close on the heels of Rahul claiming that the PM\'s Teli caste was not part of other backward classes.\n\nImportance of Caste Census\n\nIndia\'s first proper caste enumeration was under the British in 1931. Subsequently, while the constitution addressed education and job reservations for SCs and STs, the first independent govt realised there were numerous underprivileged backward communities, resulting in the Kaka Kalekar commission in 1953, which recommended a caste-wise census enumeration in the 1961 census.\n\nBut it was the Mandal Commis sion\'s 1980 report that proved pivotal, identifying 3,742 OBC communities and recommending 52% quotas, though only 27% reservations were implemented by VP Singh\'s government in 1989 amid violent protests and legal battles.\n\nA landmark 1993 Supreme Court judgement (Indira Sawhney case) capped overall reservations at 50% but allowed exceptions. It also introduced the \'creamy layer\' excluded from reservation based on annual income limits, currently Rs 8 lakh.\n\nKarnataka Pioneers\n\nIn Karnataka, Mysore ruler Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar appointed the Leslie Miller Commission to examine non-Brahmin underrepresentation in 1918, despite opposition from then-Diwan M Visvesvaraya.\n\nPost-independence, the Nagana Gowda Commission (1960) recommended 45% job and 50% education quotas for OBCs, excluding Lingayats, which prevented implementation. Then, the 1975 LG Havanur panel raised the quantum to 32% across the three categories it introduced. But the exclusion of Lingayats again caused friction.\n\nTo address this, the T Venkataswamy Commission was formed, which, in its 1986 report, included some Lingayat sub-castes, and again, in the 1990 O Chinnappa Reddy report, included Vokkaligas and Lingayats, who were dissatisfied with the representation. This finally led to the creation of a permanent BC commission. The first BC panel in 1994 was led by Kudur Narayana Pai.\n\nAnd then in 2015, Siddaramaiah set up the H Kantharaju Commission to carry out a socio-economic educational survey, commonly called a caste census. While Siddaramaiah\'s tenure as CM ended before the report could be submitted, leaked contents from it created heartburn among Vokkaligas and Lingayats. Subsequent governments didn\'t accept the report, citing multiple reasons, including the technicality that the member secretary hadn\'t signed it. This prompted the Jayaprakash Hegde commission, which, using the Kantharaju panel\'s data, has submitted its report.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
277,277,"b'Akhilesh.Singh@timesgroup.com\n\nNew Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s focus Tuesday on Congress\'s efforts to introduce quota for Muslims marks a significant escalation of BJP\'s ""appeasement"" charge against the opposition party.\n\nPM fired the ""Muslim quota"" salvo while addressing a rally at Tonk-Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan -- his last engagement in the state for Lok Sabha polls -- and said Congress has for long made separate efforts to implement Muslim quota despite the prohibition laid down on ""Babasaheb Ambedkar\'s Constitution"" on religion-based reservations.\n\nThe attack came even as Congress was still angrily protesting against PM\'s remark at Banswara, also in Rajasthan, on Sunday that Congress\'s pitch for ""redistibution of assets"" was part of a plan to take away assets from people and distribute among people who, going by his predecessor Manmohan Singh\'s 2006 speech at the National Development Council, can only be Muslims.\n\nWhile Election Commission has started an inquiry into Congress\'s complaint that that Banswara speech was communal and, therefore, violative of the \'model code of conduct\', PM Modi repeated the charge and rebutted Congress\'s protest about Singh\'s statement having been distorted, saying, ""I was present at the meeting of the NDC.""\n\nGoing by indications, the PM\'s consecutive volleys could be part of a larger offensive against the ""equity"" section of the Congress manifesto for allegedly seeking to create an opening for Muslims not just in jobs and education, but also in healthcare, public contracts, skill development, even sports -- something which might push the electoral contest from now on to the ""secular-communal"" terrain.\n\nHighlighting extracts from the ""equity"" section of the Congress manifesto, BJP said that it implied Muslim reservation. ""Point 3 of the Congress manifesto says \'encourage\' minorities to take full advantage of opportunities but Point 6 says \'ensure\' minorities receive \'fair share\' on exactly the same issues as mentioned in Point 3,"" a senior BJP leader said and added, ""if Congress manifesto had limited itself to just \'encourage\', then it would have been OK. But how will Congress ensure? Such language is employed when the intent is to back the promise with legislative action.""\n\nCongress manifesto in ""equity"" section says that it will do socio-economic census (different from caste census) and then basis this it will strengthen affirmative action (Point 1). Same section also says in Point 2 that the 50% limit on reservations will be raised. ""Read together, only one conclusion follows. Congress plans to install Muslim reservation -- not just in education and jobs but also in healthcare, public contracts, skill development, cultural activities and even sports?"" the BJP leader said.\n\nCongress in its manifesto in 2009 Lok Sabha polls had promised nationwide reservation for Muslims in jobs and education. The idea was to create a Muslim sub-quota within the 27% OBC quota. Although it could not be implemented due to legal hurdles but Congress in its manifesto in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls again mentioned that the UPA govt had taken steps to address the condition of backward Muslims by aiming to provide them reservation in educational institutions and govt jobs and further added, ""We will pursue this matter closely in court to ensure that the policy is implemented through proper legislation"".\n\nThe saffron party made a recall that Congress launched its pilot project to introduce Muslim quota in Andhra Pradesh after coming to power in 2004 when it made four attempts between 2004-10 to implement Muslim reservation. ""Each time the Andhra HC/SC quashed the pernicious attempts of Congress. Unashamed, the UPA then tried the Muslim reservation at ventral level in 2011. Even this attempt was stalled by Andhra HC in2012 and SC agreed with HC,"" a BJP leader said.\n\nIn Karnataka, Congress promised to reinstate Muslim reservation that the BJP govt had scrapped. And finally in its 2024 manifesto, Congress talks of expanding affirmative action after socio-economic survey -- breach 50% limit set by courts and ""ensure"" Muslims receive their ""fair share"" in jobs, education and even sports.\n\n""In UPA-1, Ranganath Mishra Commission recommended 10% reservation for Muslims, which Congress gave in Andhra despite being rejected by the high court. Congress removed all reservation of SC/ST OBC from AMU and Jamia Millia Islamia to provide for Muslims,"" said BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi.\n\nHe said in Kashmir, Congress never allowed SC/ST and OBCs to have reservation in representation on the pretext that it is a Muslim majority state and the Muslim Waqf Board by law became the biggest land owner after the Govt of India, due to successive Congress-led govts.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""We will legally back MSP for farmers. Congress had earlier waived loans for farmers, and we will do it again. Around Rs 22 lakh crore of corporate loans have been waived by this govt, while our farmers suffer,"" said Gandhi.\n\nThe former national president of Congress said Modi made many wrong decisions which in turn impacted the people.

What Anant Hegde, Jyoti Mirdha, Lallu Singh or BJP\'s posterboy Arun Govil earlier said on campaign trail - that give BJP a large majority so it can change the Constitution. Their seniors\' silence shows their support. People have to decide if they have to save the govt, or, save Ambedkar\'s Constitution.\n\nWhat media shows is far from ground reality.Jobs, Agniveer, inflation, women\'s safety, caste census are big issues. Congress manifesto is subject of in-depth discussion among people. There\'s desperation in BJP, and it will reflect in their speeches.\n\nBut BJP is presumed to be winning its third LS term.\n\nThere\'s no consensus BJP\'s winning. Two phases of voting are over. People have shown their anger against govt. Many BJP candidates and MPs have refused to contest elections: Gautam Gambhir, Jayant Sinha, VK Singh, Birender Singh. Attempts to create an atmosphere for \'400 seats\' failed. I\'ve been to Kerala, UP, Uttarakhand, Thar, J&K, Karnataka, Maharashtra. BJP\'s losing on seats it considered safe - like Udhampur, Chandrapur (Maha). Even Nagpur was a tough fight. This is the mood on the ground. INDIA\'s got a tremendous boost.\n\nSo your campaign will stick to people\'s issues?\n\nBJP has no achievement to show for 10 years in office. That is this govt\'s biggest failure. Congress as a secular party speaks about \'hissedari\' and social justice, jobs, women\'s empowerment. Despite defeats in two elections, Rahul Gandhi has stuck to people\'s and country\'s issues. He is a stubborn politician. It is Rahul\'s victory that Congress manifesto has forced BJP veterans on the backfoot. We pulled this election back to issues, which was a big defeat for them.\n\nMany Congress seniors have joined BJP. That must hurt.\n\nI make a distinction between those who leave Congress of their own will, and those who\'re forced to join BJP. But it\'s a victory of the Nehruvian school of thought that despite a decade in power, BJP could not establish its own leadership that is intellectually and politically strong.\n\nThey\'ve had to take the Ashok Chavans and Milind Deoras, and drop their own ideological flag bearers like Sadhvi Pragya, Pratap Simha, Anand Hegde. But it has made no dent to Congress. Seniors have left but not the people. Shiv Sena and NCP split up, but situation is such that BJP had to drop Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar as star campaigners.\n\nDo you find yourself doubly vulnerable?\n\nYou run that risk, you have to face it. In Parliament, a BJP MP hurled an innuendo by talking about a neighbouring country\'s prime minister, and I said, ""Main Bharat ka Imran hun."" This demolishes their campaign against me. The situation is dangerous. Statements like ""identifying people by their clothes"" and the silence on acts of hatred, matter. But that ploy, tried even today, has run its course. Hatred has a shelf life.\n\nOne Bharat Jodo Yatra was enough to demolish BJP\'s caricature of Rahul Gandhi. What is BJP\'s USP if it doesn\'t fire from the Muslim\'s shoulders? Fear is always there, but you have to face it.\n\nAre the crowds for the poet or the Congress campaigner?\n\nI\'m a Rajya Sabha member, and as head of Congress\'s minority department, I connect communities of Jains, Sikhs, Parsis, Bauddh, Christians and Muslims with Congress organisationally. As a star campaigner, I amplify Congress\'s commitments. I use poetic language, my trade, to connect with people. When in Banihal, Ghulam Nabi\'s home, I said politicians ""apne bangle bachane ke liye tumhare khwabon ke gharonde bech diye"" (to save their bungalows, they sold your dreams), the gathering concurred. When you frame issues in poetry, people connect.\n\nAre rally crowds converting into votes for Congress?\n\nI have a personal fan base and Congress has an organisation and workers. It\'s a double advantage. I try to convince audiences on social issues, which are also central ideas of my poetry. I\'ve never done shayari of \'zulfo-shaam\' (adulatory/ romantic). I have spoken about farmers\' issues, lynching, about Najeeb, Pehlu Khan. So, my political speeches tie in with my poetry. It is a plus for the party.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They say it\'s a strategy to neutralise the impact of BJP\'s narrative centred on ""wealth distribution"".\n\nCommunalise polls | While attacking Congress\' manifesto and the caste census, PM Narendra Modi has alleged that Congress is trying to take away reservation meant for OBCs and give it to Muslims. Even on Monday, when he wrapped up his Karnataka campaign with a rally in Bagalkot, Modi said BJP would never allow Congress to implement religion-based reservation.\n\n""BJP, as usual, is trying to communalise these elections,"" said a senior Congress MLC, who is in-charge of the campaign in Haveri and Dharwad Lok Sabha constituencies. ""We will appeal to people not to fall into the trap.

However, the Centre is yet to issue notification to this effect.

287,287,"b'PM Modi may have sparked a row by accusing Congress of snatching reservation from OBCs and SC/STs to give it to Muslims, but in Karnataka, which he cited as an example, the issue has dominated multiple elections, including the 2023 assembly polls that Congress won.\n\nIn fact, the action in Karnataka precedes the demand for a caste census by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, which came on the heels of a statewide survey in Bihar.\n\nResponding to the PM\'s criticism, Kharge told TOI: ""While it is popularly being called a caste census, what we are proposing to do is a socioeconomic and educational survey that aims to assess and identify communities eligible for welfare schemes. We\'ve already implemented several schemes like MGNREGA, which aren\'t based on caste but on needs of all communities. Modi is making the issue communal solely for electoral gain.""\n\nKarnataka has been at the forefront of the caste survey issue -- much like with \'guarantees\' this season -- and a report on it was submitted by a commission headed by Jayaprakash Hegde, now Congress candidate from UdupiChikmagalur. The Siddaramaiah govt accepted the report but is yet to implement its recommendations.\n\nCampaign plots of LS polls in Karnataka include the OBC narrative. If Siddaramaiah with his Ahinda credentials is Congress\'s lead actor, BJP has been projecting PM Modi as the OBC face.\n\nShivaraj Thangadagi, Karnataka backward classes welfare minister, told TOI: ""Our govt has done what none had before by accepting the report. Its implementation will not only benefit backward communities but also the party, for sticking to its commitment. The concerns of other communities will be addressed while implementing this.""\n\nUnion home minister Amit Shah and Karnataka leader of opposition R Ashoka have reiterated how BJP was with OBCs with Modi being ""sabse bada (biggest) OBC"" during their campaigns in the state.\n\nNationally, Nitish Kumar -- who had commissioned the Bihar caste survey -- leaving INDIA and Congress being concerned about caste matrices across states may have seen the party use the OBC card cautiously, but it has included it in its national manifesto, while BJP continues to actively woo these communities.\n\n""Congress didn\'t tolerate leaders from extremely backward classes. In 1987, Congress refused to accept Karpoori Thakurji as opposition leader whom we honoured a few days ago with Bharat Ratna. These days, Congress colleagues express concern about the number of people from backward classes in govt, where they\'re positioned... But I\'m surprised they don\'t notice the biggest OBC (referring to himself),"" Modi told Parliament on Feb 5.\n\nThe PM referring to himself as the biggest OBC came close on the heels of Rahul claiming that Modi\'s Teli caste was not part of other backward classes.\n\nNational Scene\n\nIndia\'s first proper caste enumeration was under the British in 1931. Subsequently, while the Constitution addressed education and job reservations for SC/STs, the first independent govt realised there were numerous underprivileged backward commu nities, resulting in the Kaka Kalekar commission in 1953, which recommended a castewise census enumeration in the 1961 Census.\n\nBut it was Mandal Commission\'s 1980 report that proved pivotal, identifying 3,742 OBC communities and recommending 52% quotas -- though only 27% reservations were implemented by V P Singh\'s govt in 1989 amid violent protests and legal battles.\n\nA landmark 1993 Supreme Court judgment (Indira Sawhney case) capped overall reservations at 50% but allowed exceptions. It also introduced the \'creamy layer\' excluded from reservation, based on annual income limits, currently Rs 8 lakh.\n\nKarnataka Pioneers Mysore ruler Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar appointed the Leslie Miller commission to examine non-Brahmin underrepresentation in 1918, despite opposition from then Divan M Visvesvaraya.\n\nPost-Independence, Nagana Gowda Commission (1960) recommended 45% job and 50% education quotas for OBCs, excluding Lingayats, which prevented implementation. Then, the 1975 LG Havanur panel raised the quantum to 32% across the three categories it introduced. But the exclusion of Lingayats again caused friction.\n\nTo address this, the T Venkataswamy commission was formed, which, in its 1986 re port, included some Lingayat sub-castes and, again, the 1990 O Chinnappa Reddy commission included Muslims, Vokkaligas and Lingayats, but the latter two were dissatisfied with the representation. This finally led to creation of a permanent BC commission, with the first in 1994 led by Kudur Narayana Pai.\n\nThe Chinnappa Reddy report recommendation was implemented in 1994-95 and has since been used as the matrix for reservations in the state.\n\nAnd in 2015, CM Siddaramaiah set up the H Kantharaju commission to carry out a socio-economic educational survey, commonly called caste survey. While Siddaramaiah\'s tenure ended before the report could be submitted, leaked contents created heartburn among Vokkaligas and Lingayats. Subsequent govts didn\'t accept the report citing reasons, including a technicality that the membersecretary hadn\'t signed it. This prompted the Jayaprakash Hegde commission to revisit the Kantharaju panel report. The Hegde commission has since submitted its report to the Siddaramaiah govt.\n\nIn between, BJP\'s Basavaraj Bommai govt had in Dec 2022 rejigged the categories based on which existing reservation was being implemented. It removed Muslims and added an additional quota for Vokkaligas and Lingayats. But its implementation is stalled as a case is pending before Supreme Court.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""We are only demanding that the survey should be done in a scientific manner to assess the population accurately. In that sense, the manifesto of Congress is on the right track as it promises to conduct the survey afresh at the national level. But the party must convey this message properly if it wants the support of Lingayats in these elections.""\n\nChief minister Siddaramaiah commissioned the caste census during his previous term in 2015 and Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes, headed by H Kantharaju was entrusted with the job. But the Kantharaju commission could not submit its report due to a technical error. A new commission, headed by K Jayaprakash Hegde, rectified the ""error"" before submitting the report to the govt.\n\nMuch to Congress\' discomfiture, those criticising the report include senior partymen from the Lingayat community like MLA Shamanur Shivashankarappa and minister Eshwar Khandre. Even deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar, a Vok kaliga, had voiced concerns over the report.\n\nHowever, the govt has consistently said the cabinet will discuss the report and then decide whether to make it public. ""There is no confusion among people, so it will not affect Congress\' poll prospects,"" said Khandre, who is also secretary-general of the Mahasabha. His son Sagar is contesting as the Congress candidate from Bidar.\n\nSpreading \'awareness\': BJP\n\nBut BJP functionaries insist that the caste census is an issue, especially in the Lingayat belt. They said the issue was not well-pronounced in the first phase of polls in the Vokkaliga belt in south Karnataka since public campaigning had almost ended by the time Modi brought up the issue.\n\n""The caste census amounts to appeasement politics by Congress,"" said N Ravikumar, who is in-charge of BJP\'s campaign in Bellary and Davanagere.

The Congress stand that BRS and BJP have entered into a secret understanding has been vindicated with BRS former minister Ch Malla Reddy openly supporting BJP\'s Eatala Rajender in Malkajgiri constituency. Even Eatala, party leaders G Kishan Reddy and Bandi Sanjay were not saying that reservations will not be scrapped, he said.\n\n""BRS-BJP secret deal is exposed in the fact that the BRS has not taken action against Malla Reddy. KCR should suspend him from the party if the BRS has not made any secret deal with BJP for getting bail for his daughter K Kavitha in the Delhi liquor scam. I have already said that KCR-led BRS has mortgaged five Lok Sabha seats to the BJP in his attempt to get bail for his daughter,"" Revanth alleged.\n\nAlso, KCR is following the same ideology of BJP on changing the Constitution as he himself talked about it.

Votes are due to be counted on June 4 and results expected the same day.\n\nModi, 73, is widely tipped to win a record-equalling third term on the back of his 10-year record, which includes strong economic growth, infrastructure projects, welfare handouts and aggressive Hindu nationalism.\n\nSurveys, however, suggest unemployment, inflation and rural distress remain issues of concern in the world\'s most populous country despite its strong economy, and addressing these will be Modi\'s biggest challenge.\n\n""Our focus is on dignity of life ... on quality of life, our focus is also on creating jobs through investment,"" Modi said after releasing the manifesto, titled Modi\'s Guarantee, at the party headquarters in the capital.\n\nModi said the manifesto is focused on creating jobs in sectors such as infrastructure, aviation, railways, electric vehicles, green energy, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, among others, in a bid to address discontent at unemployment levels that are rising despite strong economic growth.\n\n""India\'s youth will not have even imagined the number of opportunities that will come their way,"" he told cheering BJP members, including top federal ministers who sat in the audience wearing stoles featuring the BJP\'s lotus symbol.\n\nCONGRESS CLAIMS EMPTY PROMISES\n\nCongress, the main opposition party, which has been struggling to revive its fortunes, said it was not impressed by a manifesto that is filled with ""empty promises"".\n\n""Today, people want to ask what happened in the last 10 years,"" Congress lawmaker Manish Tewari said. ""Unemployment is rampant and inflation has broken the back of common people. The people of the country will hold him (Modi) to account for what\'s happened in the last 10 years.""\n\nModi also vowed to expand welfare programmes, including bringing all Indians above the age of 70 under an existing free health insurance programme and pushing piped cooking gas connections to all houses to follow up on a subsidised cooking gas cylinder programme launched in 2016.\n\nOther BJP promises include raising the cap on loans for non-farming small and micro borrowers, offering free housing for another 30 million poor and keeping up a free grains programme for 800 million Indians until 2029.\n\nThe manifesto said the BJP government would continue to focus on a path of low inflation and fiscal prudence to achieve high economic growth.\n\n""The ambition of the 1.4 billion people of the country is Modi\'s mission,"" Modi said. ""I am placing this manifesto before the people to seek their blessings. Please bless us ... to increase our strength ... implement this manifesto and ensure a developed India.""\n\nUnemployment was the primary concern of 27% of the 10,000 voters surveyed by Lokniti-CSDS across 19 of India\'s 28 states, with rising prices coming second at 23%, the Hindu newspaper reported last week.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 5.4% in 2022/23, from 4.9% in 2013/14 just before Modi swept to power, and nearly 16% of urban youth in the 15-29 years age group remained unemployed in 2022/23 due to poor skills and a lack of quality jobs, official data shows.\n\n""BJP does not even want to discuss the most important issues related to people\'s lives,"" Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X.

300,300,"b'By Aditya Kalra, Munsif Vengattil and Dhwani Pandya\n\nMUMBAI, April 22 (Reuters) - In fake videos that have gone viral online, two of India\'s A-lister Bollywood actors are seen criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asking people to vote for the opposition Congress party in the country\'s ongoing general election.\n\nIn a 30-second video that shows Aamir Khan and another 41-second clip of Ranveer Singh, the two Bollywood actors purportedly say Modi failed to keep campaign promises and failed to address critical economic issues during his two terms as prime minister.\n\nBoth AI-generated videos end with the Congress election symbol and slogan: ""Vote for Justice, Vote for Congress"".\n\nThe two videos have been viewed on social media more than half a million times since last week, a Reuters review shows.\n\nTheir spread underlines the potential role such AI (artificial intelligence)-generated content can play in the mammoth Indian election that started on Friday and will continue until June. AI and AI-generated fakes, or deepfakes, are being increasingly used in elections elsewhere in the world, including in the U.S., Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nCampaigning in India has long focused on door-to-door outreach and public rallies, but extensive use of WhatsApp and Facebook as campaigning tools started in 2019. This year\'s general election - in which Modi is expected to secure a rare third term - is the first in which AI is being used.\n\nA Congress spokesperson, Sujata Paul, shared actor Singh\'s video with her 16,000 followers on X on April 17 and by Saturday afternoon, her post had been reshared 2,900 times, liked 8,700 times and received 438,000 views.\n\nPaul told Reuters by telephone she was aware the video was marked ""manipulated media"" by X, but she did not want to delete it as, while posting, she thought the person was a look alike of Singh and ""it has creativity for sure"".\n\nThe post was no longer visible on X on Sunday, hours after Reuters sent a request for comment to Congress\' head of social media cell, who did not respond.\n\nBoth actors have said the videos are fake. Facebook, X and at least eight fact-checking websites have said they are altered or manipulated, which the Reuters digital verification unit has also confirmed.\n\nReuters could not ascertain who created the videos. Khan was ""alarmed"" by the viral ""fake"" video and Singh\'s team was looking into the matter, according to a spokesperson for both actors. Singh wrote on X on Friday: ""Beware of deepfakes, friends"".\n\nModi\'s office, and the IT head of his Bharatiya Janata Party, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPOLICE PROBE\n\nNearly 900 million people in India have access to the Internet and a survey conducted by research organization Esya Centre and the Indian Institute of Management business school showed an average Indian spends over three hours a day on social media. The country has nearly one billion voters.\n\nSome versions of the videos have been blocked on social media but at least 14 were still visible on X on Saturday. Facebook deleted two videos Reuters flagged to the company but one other was still visible.\n\nFacebook in a statement said it has ""removed the videos"" for violation of its policies. X did not respond to Reuters queries.\n\nThe videos have sparked one police investigation with Khan registering a case in Mumbai against unnamed persons on April 17 for alleged impersonation and cheating for creating the fake video.\n\nMumbai police did not return a request for comment, but two officers working on Khan\'s case, who declined to be named, said they wrote to Facebook and X to take down the video and the companies had said it was done.\n\nThe officers said they were up until 2 a.m. on Friday, refreshing pages to check if Khan\'s online videos were removed. Asked about progress in the case, one of them said: ""Such technical investigations take time.""\n\nAI VIDEO OF DEAD FATHER\n\nIn this year\'s election, politicians are using AI in other ways.\n\nIn southern India, Congress leader Vijay Vasanth\'s spokesperson said his team has created a 2-minute audio-video clip using AI that was shared on social media platforms and shows his now dead but more popular politician father, H. Vasanthakumar, seeking votes for him.\n\nThe late politician is seen saying ""even though my body left you all, my soul is still around.""\n\nIn videos put out on YouTube by the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM), Samata, an AI-generated anchor dressed in a traditional saree and speaking in a style that mimics regular news channels, criticizes the ruling party in West Bengal state.\n\nIn one clip, the anchor alleges the party does not care about the environment as many water bodies have vanished due to illegal construction.\n\nA spokesperson for the ruling party denied the allegation and said the state government has ensured no such construction takes place. The CPM did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the video, which has been seen 12,000 times, anchor Samata declares: ""These are questions that we the citizens of this city need to ponder over.""

301,301,"b'BARPETA/THIRUVANANTHPURAM, India, May 7 (Reuters) - As India votes in a six-week general election, Narendra Modi\'s image adorns everything from packs of rice handed out to the poor to large posters in cities and towns.\n\nHis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is relying on the prime minister\'s popularity as it seeks a super-majority in India\'s parliament. Its message: Modi has delivered economic growth, infrastructure upgrades and India\'s improved standing in the world.\n\nBut as the Hindu nationalist party and its allies target 400 of the 543 seats in India\'s lower house of parliament - up from 352 won in 2019 - they are also employing local tactics in some vital constituencies they hope to wrest from the opposition. Opinion polls indicate Modi will win a rare third term when voting ends on June 1. But only once in Indian history has a party crossed the 400 mark - when the centre-left Congress party romped to victory following the assassination of its leader Indira Gandhi in 1984.\n\nTo examine how the right-wing National Democratic Alliance (NDA) aims to achieve that feat - and the obstacles it faces - Reuters spoke to nine NDA officials, three opposition leaders and two political analysts, as well as voters in six opposition-held seats the alliance is targeting.\n\nThey identified three of the BJP\'s key tactics: enlisting celebrity candidates to unseat veteran opposition lawmakers; making an assault on the opposition\'s southern strongholds by appealing to minorities such as Christians; and exploiting redrawn political boundaries that bolster the Hindu electorate in some opposition-controlled areas in the north.\n\n""A combination of strategies, organisational commitment and tactical flexibility will help make inroads in seats never held by the party ever before,"" BJP President J. P. Nadda, who oversees the party\'s election strategy, told Reuters in April. Some critics have warned the BJP would use a large majority to push through a more radical agenda in a third term. While the BJP\'s manifesto focuses heavily on economic growth, it has also pledged to scrap separate legal codes for religious and tribal groups in areas such as marriage and inheritance. Many Muslims and tribal groups oppose the plan, which would require a constitutional amendment to be passed by at least two-thirds of parliament.\n\n""Modi wants a landslide majority only to be able to end the debate and deliberation on any policy matter in the parliament,"" Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge told Reuters. Following low turnout in early voting, some BJP campaign officials have in recent days appeared less confident of securing a huge majority, though the party still expects to form the next government.\n\nSOUTHERN STRATEGY Modi\'s party has criticised the dynastic politics that it says afflicts Congress, long dominated by the Nehru-Gandhi family. But in Pathanamthitta, a seat in the southern state of Kerala, it is fielding a political scion in Anil Antony - son of a veteran Congress leader.\n\nThe constituency, home to a sizeable Christian minority, has been held by Congress since its creation in 2009.\n\nAnil\'s father, former defense minister A.K. Antony, supports the incumbent and has denounced his son, a fellow Christian, for representing the Hindu nationalist party.\n\nBut Anil has another supporter: Modi, who came to Pathanamthitta in March and praised the BJP candidate for his ""fresh vision and leadership"". The prime minister has visited the five states of southern India at least 16 times since December.\n\nNadda, the BJP president, acknowledged that winning a supermajority would require performing well in the five southern states, which are home to about 20% of India\'s population but have not traditionally voted for his party.\n\nIn 2019, the NDA won just 31 of 130 seats across Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, all of which are linguistically diverse and have many Muslim and Christian voters.\n\nJiji Joseph, general secretary of the BJP\'s minority wing in Kerala, said the party has made a concerted push for the 18% of voters there who are Christians. The BJP did not win a single seat in Kerala at the last general election.\n\n""The BJP launched active contact with the Church and we started interacting with clergies directly,"" he said, adding that the party now has 11,000 active Christian members. ""There is a change. Christians now want to believe that BJP stands for them.""\n\nIn April, Anil became the first BJP candidate in Kerala to be endorsed by Christian leaders. He told Reuters his selection indicated the party offered opportunities to members from minority groups. He declined to comment on relations with his father. Jayant Joseph, a Keralan Christian voter, said he backed the BJP because he had read media reports about Muslim men marrying Christian women and converting them to Islam. Most moderate Hindus consider allegations of large-scale forced conversions to be a conspiracy theory.\n\n""Kerala is a secular state,"" he said. ""But for it to continue to be a secular state, the Muslim population and their conversion strategy must be kept under check.""\n\nA Modi political aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to media, said the NDA expects to win about 50 seats in the south.\n\nK. Anil Kumar, a senior leader of Kerala\'s ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), said he did not believe BJP would do well in his state, which he said has a strong tradition of secularism. ""The BJP might try to side with the Christians on some issues but they are fundamentally a party of the Hindus and for the Hindus,"" he said.\n\nSTAR CANDIDATES\n\nIn the Mandi constituency of the northern state of Himachal Pradhesh, the BJP has recruited Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut to break the Congress party\'s grip on power. Congress is fielding as its candidate Vikramaditya Singh, whose mother currently represents the constituency. His father was the state\'s long-time chief minister.\n\nRanaut, a political novice who calls herself a ""glorious right-wing"" personality, has starred in popular movies with nationalistic themes. She is known for her criticism of Bollywood executives who she said favoured the relatives of famous actors for opportunities. The actress is one of five actors running for the BJP this year, up from four in 2019.\n\nNo opinion polling on the Mandi race is publicly available.\n\nAnjana Negia, an elementary school teacher who plans to vote for Ranaut, acknowledged that her preferred candidate had no political experience. But she said that she valued a new face and that a Modi-backed candidate would help ""bring a fresh wave of development.""\n\nFielding celebrities and seeking the endorsement of entertainment personalities is relatively new for the BJP, which ""long resisted such tactics because of its cadre-based nature"" that prized grassroots efforts, said Milan Vaishnav, an expert on South Asian politics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank.\n\nRanaut declined an interview request. Federal BJP spokesman Shahzad Poonawala said she ""has been successful in exposing dynastic culture and nepotism in Bollywood and now she is doing the same in politics.""\n\nSingh, a state minister responsible for urban development, told Reuters that his family\'s experiences gave him a better understanding of politics. Charges of nepotism were ""shallow"", he said.\n\nREDISTRICTING BENEFITS\n\nThe NDA is hoping for gains in the northeastern state of Assam, where it won nine of 14 seats in 2019. Assam\'s BJP chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, said in March he was confident of winning 13 seats.\n\nThe NDA\'s confidence is rooted in a 2023 redistricting exercise in the state. India\'s non-partisan Election Commission routinely redraws seat boundaries to reflect population changes; it is tasked with ensuring that no political party gains undue advantage from the changes.\n\nBut exercises since the last federal election in Assam and far-northern Jammu and Kashmir, India\'s only majority Muslim region, diluted the Muslim vote in seats that the NDA is targeting, according to three BJP and four opposition officials.\n\nThe Election Commission declined to comment on the two exercises, citing the ongoing election.\n\nIn Assam, the NDA has high hopes for Congress-held Barpeta, which alliance candidate Phani Bhushan Choudhury said newly includes dozens of villages and some towns with large Hindu populations.\n\n""Earlier (Barpeta) had a Muslim majority but now it is a Hindu majority,"" said Choudhury. ""That change has worked in my favour."" He estimates that there are now 1.2 million Hindu voters in Barpeta, where he is campaigning on development and protecting the rights of what the NDA calls ""indigenous Assamese"" voters, who are mostly Hindu.\n\nChoudhury\'s Congress opponent Deep Bayan said the percentage of Hindus in Barpeta went from 30% to 70%. ""Instead focusing on real issues affecting the people...(the BJP does) the politics of polarisation,"" he said.\n\nThree of Jammu and Kashmir\'s five seats are majority Muslim and held by the opposition. But the NDA hopes to swing one of them, Anantnag-Rajouri, after its voter rolls swelled by more than 50% to over 2 million, according to government data.\n\nMany of the new voters are Hindus or from regional tribes - which benefited from new BJP policies awarding them education and employment privileges - according to regional BJP chief Ravinder Raina.\n\nRaina said the BJP would support an NDA partner that it believed could win Anantnag-Rajouri and focus on retaining the two Hindu-majority seats it holds.\n\nThe two redistricting exercises presages a broader remapping of constituencies due after the election.\n\nVaishnav, of the Carnegie Endowment, said the remapping would distribute seats to the BJP-dominated north, which has much higher population growth rates, to the detriment of wealthier south India.

303,303,"b'NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Animated videos shared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s party targeting opposition Congress and the Muslim community have evoked complaints and outrage, as the political climate in India heats up midway through its six-week long election.\n\nThe videos, shared by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party on social media platforms Instagram and X over the last ten days, depict the Congress giving disproportionate benefits to India\'s minority Muslim community, at the cost of certain disadvantaged tribal and Hindu caste groups.\n\nThe Congress, in a complaint to the poll watchdog Election Commission, said on Sunday that the video has been shared ""clearly with an intention to wantonly provocate rioting and promote enmity between different religions"".\n\nA set of guidelines mutually adopted by political parties for how they should conduct themselves during the election period prohibit them from creating ""mutual hatred"" between caste, religious or linguistic groups.\n\nManipulated videos on social media have also become a contentious issue in this election, such as fake videos showing top Bollywood stars criticizing the prime minister.\n\nOn Monday, the commission warned parties against the misuse of AI tools to create deep fakes and told them not to publish and circulate such videos. It also said parties had been directed to remove such content within three hours of it being brought to their notice.\n\nModi, the face of the Hindu-nationalist BJP, seeking a rare third consecutive term, had focused his campaign largely on his government\'s performance on economic growth and welfare benefits.\n\nBut he changed tack after the first phase of voting on April 19 and his campaign speeches have since become more polarising on religious lines, accusing Congress of planning to redistribute the wealth of the majority Hindus among minority Muslims, who he called ""infiltrators"" who have ""more children"".\n\nThe videos shared by the BJP over the last ten days, one of which has since been taken down, illustrated the same message.\n\nA 17-second video shared by a state unit of BJP on May 4, with over 8.5 million views, shows a character resembling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi feeding ""funds"" to a bird in a skullcap, which eventually pushes out from their common nest three other birds representing other disadvantaged groups.\n\nThe Congress has filed a police complaint against BJP leaders for the video, BJP\'s head of information and technology Amit Malviya said on X.\n\n""The Congress should in fact thank the BJP for taking their manifesto to the people in a manner that even they couldn\'t,"" he wrote.\n\nThe video has elicited outrage. Nitasha Kaul, a politics professor at London\'s Westminster University said on X that the video was a ""straightforward 1930s Germany style cartoon"".\n\nIn its manifesto for the elections, the Congress has promised to tackle India\'s economic inequality by conducting a socio-economic caste census and extending affirmative action. It said it will ensure that minorities receive ""their fair share"" of education, economic and healthcare opportunities.\n\nAn Election Commission spokesperson, the BJP\'s Malviya and Congress spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik, additional reporting by Shivangi Acharya and Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Toby Chopra)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

India has a population of 1.42 billion people.\n\nCongress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said Modi\'s ""deeply objectionable"" statement violated sections of the law that prohibit candidates from asking people to vote or refrain from voting for anyone on the grounds of ""religion"", ""community"" or ""religious symbols"".\n\n""We have asked the Election Commission to state that this is the position in law,"" Singhvi told reporters, urging it to act against Modi in the same way it would against anyone else accused of similar offences.\n\nThe Election Commission did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nModi\'s government has repeatedly been accused of discrimination against Muslims, with civil society, opposition groups, and some foreign governments raising concerns over decisions they say are aimed at fanning discrimination and keeping the BJP in power.\n\nThe government has denied all accusations, and Modi has said he works for the betterment of all.\n\nUnder election laws, the Election Commission can ask a party or its leader to respond to a complaint, issue advisories cautioning them or prohibit them from campaigning for a specified period, or launch a criminal case against repeat offenders.\n\nIndia\'s seven-week election began on April 19 and will end on June 1, with results due on June 4.\n\n(Additional reporting by Shivangi Acharya; Editing by YP Rajesh and Alison Williams)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""There is no level playing field in this election.""\n\nIt echoed a similar rally more than 40 years earlier on the same spot, when opposition leaders fired up huge crowds to help change the course of the 1977 election - ending the 10-year rule of India\'s powerful third prime minister and political scion Indira Gandhi.\n\nGandhi had imposed a state of emergency, jailed key opposition leaders and curtailed civil freedoms. To some, India\'s future was perched on a needle point between autocracy and democracy. She lost the election and, in the eyes of many, India\'s democracy was saved.\n\nTo many supporters in the crowd three weeks ago, India is now at a similar crossroads with this high-stakes election deciding which path the country follows.\n\n""Our democracy is being murdered, India is becoming a dictatorship,"" Hazari Lal Rajput, a resident from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, told CNN at the Ramlila Maidan.\n\nSupporters of India\'s opposition party, Indian National Congress, during an election rally in Puducherry on April 15, 2024 R.

Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\n\nBut India\'s opposition leaders accuse Modi\'s right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles ahead of elections, which began on April 19 and run until June 1, with results counted on June 4.\n\nThey also warn Modi\'s brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting.\n\nIndia\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023. Matthew Abbott/The New York Times/Redux Narendra Modi was born in 1950, three years after India\'s independence, to mother Hiraben and father Damodardas, a teaseller, in the western state of Gujarat. His entry into politics began at just eight years old when when he enrolled in classes at the local branch of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing organization that advocates for the supremacy of Hinduism in India NaMo App As a teen, Modi traveled across India with the RSS and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1987, a then fringe political party which started gaining traction fueled by the rise of Hindu nationalism in India.

Amr Alfiky/Reuters Narendra Modi, in pictures Prev Next\n\nModi and the BJP have denied political interference, with one senior party leader saying it was a ""process of law"" to take ""appropriate action against corruption.""\n\nTo counter the BJP, the opposition has formed a 27-member bloc -- the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA.\n\nBut so far that alliance has proved lackluster, observers say. It has been beset by ideological differences, has seen a host of defections to the BJP and, even with the election in full swing, has yet to even name a prime ministerial candidate.\n\n""What kind of a democracy can you have if you don\'t have a vibrant opposition, a robust opposition that can question the government?"" asks Arati Jerath, an independent political commentator and journalist.\n\n""That\'s why it\'s not really a question of whether Modi wins or not, it\'s a question of keeping the opposition alive to fight another day so that democracy in India survives.""\n\n\'Scorched earth\'\n\nAmong those leading the charge for the opposition alliance is Rahul Gandhi, longtime face of the Congress and the latest member of his family to bid for power.\n\nHe is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India\'s first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country\'s founding prime minister.\n\n""If the BJP wins these fixed elections and changes the constitution, the country will be on fire. Remember this,"" Rahul Gandhi told the crowd in Delhi last month.\n\nThe BJP and its allies are gunning for a supermajority of more than two-thirds of the seats in India\'s parliament, the Lok Sabha. A rising fear among critics is that this would give the BJP the power to change India\'s constitution, which is rooted in the democratic principles of justice, liberty, equality and - crucially - secularism.\n\nThe BJP has repeatedly denied it has plans to change the constitution.\n\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaks during a press conference in New Delhi on March 25, 2023. Money Sharma/AFP/Getty Images\n\n""When I say that I have big plans, no one should be scared. I don\'t take decisions to scare or run over anyone, I take decisions for the wholesome development of the nation,"" Modi said in an interview with Indian news agency ANI earlier this week.\n\nBut the party has already begun publicly pulling India\'s government away from its secular foundation and leading BJP figures have openly advocated for the country to be declared a Hindu nation.\n\n""There shouldn\'t be politics on the basis of religion in any country, they should talk about real issues. Until people\'s financial situation improves, there won\'t be any social reform,"" said voter Mohammad Irfan at the opposition rally in Delhi.\n\nOpposition parties have found themselves facing a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year\'s election.\n\nGandhi\'s Congress - the largest party in the INDIA alliance -- has accused the BJP of ""tax terrorism"" and crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. It has also been landed with a $218 million tax bill.\n\nThen came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\n\nKejriwal\'s detention on graft allegations came after the announcement of the general election last month, sparking protests in the capital. Analysts say it\'s the first time in post-independence history that an Indian chief minister has governed from behind bars.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal speaks during a protest against alleged attacks on federalism by the federal government, in New Delhi, India, on February 8, 2024. Altaf Qadri/AP\n\nKejriwal has denied the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. He is just one of several prominent members of the opposition, including three other senior AAP leaders, that have also been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties.\n\n""I think there are very serious concerns about how free and fair the elections are going to be in India this time around,"" said Atishi, Delhi minister of education for the AAP, who goes by one name.\n\nReports have emerged of opposition party members being coerced into joining the BJP with the threat of arrest, while they were under investigation by state agencies. Other reports suggest politicians have had their probes dropped after switching sides.\n\nAtishi said she was also approached to switch to the BJP. ""Either you join the ruling party, and then the cases are closed or put into cold storage or if you don\'t, like the Aam Aadmi Party leaders, then the cases go ahead and you\'re arrested and put into jail,"" she said, without specifically naming who approached her.\n\nCNN cannot independently confirm the incidents and has reached out to the BJP for comment.\n\nIn his interview with ANI, Modi denied any sliding of democracy under his rule and emphasized the independence of the Election Commission and state agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate, saying political leaders make up just 3% of cases.\n\n""Shouldn\'t we let the ED work independently when it is supposed to do so?"" he said. ""I am convinced that corruption has destroyed the country. We should fight against corruption with our full strength.""\n\nAnalyst Jerath said a BJP-led campaign to weaken the opposition was part of Modi\'s ""scorched earth policy.""\n\n""Just wipe out whatever comes in your way so that this juggernaut can move on without any kind of challenge, without any obstruction,"" she said.\n\nGandhi \'not a contender\'\n\nModi is enduringly popular, analysts say, appealing to both the poor and the affluent, especially among much of the roughly 80% of India\'s population who are Hindu.\n\nDuring his 10 years in power, he has launched a raft of welfare policies including free food handouts, housing, cheap gas cylinders for women and infrastructure projects.\n\nIndia is also the world\'s fastest-growing major economy and Modi\'s presence on the world stage -- including hosting the G20 -- has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing.\n\nAuthor Christophe Jaffrelot told CNN Modi makes people feel ""proud again of being Indian.""\n\n""There is a sense in India, a constant sense, of vulnerability, a lack of self-esteem. So to be recognized as a great power in spite of everything, (that) is attributed to him,"" he said.\n\nThat does not mean there aren\'t key issues the opposition could rally around, analysts say, including the BJP\'s failure to increase education opportunities or improve health infrastructure - especially following the coronavirus pandemic, which hit India especially hard.\n\nYouth unemployment also remains a huge problem, close to 50% among 20-to-24-year-olds.\n\nBut the INDIA alliance has failed to capitalize on these weak spots, Jerath said.\n\n""They haven\'t been able to weave together a cohesive kind of campaign, come up with a catchy slogan that will fire the imagination of the voting public,"" she said.\n\nCongress leader Gandhi is one of the few opposition figures considered to have the kind of star power and name recognition to stand against Modi.\n\nBut though he may have the name, Gandhi lacks leadership skills, some analysts say.\n\nRasheed Kidwai, journalist and author of ""24 Akbar Road,"" a history of the Congress party, said it\'s a winner-takes-all election and there is ""no silver medal in politics.""\n\n""The problem with INDIA alliance is there is nobody who has that kind of hunger, who has that kind of personal(ity), who has that kind of inner sense of belonging or ownership to go in this election. Rahul is doing it but is not a contender,"" he said.\n\nGandhi recently completed a 6,713-kilometer (4,200-mile) walk across the country, starting in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur, to raise issues of poverty, unemployment, diversity and democracy with voters.\n\nDespite these efforts, the BJP has dominated the campaign narrative.\n\nA key gauge of opposition strength will be in those parts of India where the BJP has historically failed to make inroads.\n\nSupporters of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) participate in an election campaign rally on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri, India, on April 16, 2024.

""That\'s no longer true.""\n\nStill, there is optimism from some.\n\nThe AAP\'s Atishi said that despite repeated attacks against her party, it has been able to defeat the BJP in Delhi again and again.\n\n""Democracy becoming an autocracy ... That is what we are fighting against,"" she said. ""I think that the people of India have always voted very sensibly, and we hope that they do so this time.""\n\nCNN\'s Kunal Sehgal, Aishwarya S.

321,321,"b'Sam Pitroda\'s controversial remarks on inheritance tax, \'hua to hua\', and various other topics have sparked debates and criticisms. The Congress and BJP have clashed over Pitroda\'s statements, leading to further clarification and controversy.After senior Congress leader Sam Pitroda\'s comments about inheritance tax, \'hua to hua\' trended on social media. The \'hua to hua\' remark by Sam Pitroda had sparked a big controversy in 2019. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh today responded to Sam Pitroda\'s remarks on the inheritance tax law, asserting that they do not represent the party\'s official stance and accused the BJP of using the issue to divert attention during elections. ""What Mr. Pitroda says are Mr. Pitroda\'s views, they are not the views of the Indian National Congress,"" Ramesh emphasized. He added that Pitroda is entitled to express his opinions, but they should not be sensationalized.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the inheritance tax erupted when Sam Pitroda mentioned the concept during a discussion on wealth redistribution. Union Home Minister Amit Shah criticized the Congress, stating that Pitroda\'s comments exposed the party\'s true intentions and called for clarity on their stance regarding wealth distribution. Pitroda later clarified that he was merely using the US inheritance tax as an example and emphasized that his comments were taken out of context.\n\nTaking a jibe at the Congress, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said that after the comments of the Chairman of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda advocating an inheritance tax-like law, the party has been completely exposed. The Home Minister also demanded that the Congress should either withdraw or accept that distributing wealth is their intention.\n\nPitroda sought to downplay the issue saying he had only cited inheritance tax in the US as an example.\n\n""Who said 55 per cent will be taken away? Who said something like this should be done in India? Why are BJP and the media in panic? I mentioned US inheritance tax in the US only as an example in my normal conversation on TV. Can I not mention facts? I said these are the kind of issues people will have to discuss and debate. This has nothing to do with the policy of any party including Congress,"" Pitroda said in his post on X\n\nIn another incident, in 2019, Pitroda faced backlash for his ""hua-to-hua"" remark regarding the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, although he later apologized. The Congress distanced itself from Pitroda\'s comments, emphasizing that they did not reflect the party\'s position.\n\nPitroda had to later clarify. ""The statement I made was completely twisted, taken out of context because my Hindi isn\'t good, what I meant was \'jo hua vo bura hua,\' I couldn\'t translate \'bura\' in my mind,"" Pitroda said later.\n\n""What I meant was move on. We have other issues to discuss as to what BJP govt did and what it delivered. I feel sorry that my remark was misrepresented, I apologise. This has been blown out of proportion,"" he added.\n\nLast year, Pitroda\'s comments on the Ram Mandir issue stirred a controversy. He argued that issues like unemployment and the economy should take precedence over religious matters.\n\n""I have no problem with any religion. It is okay to go visit the temple once in a while, but you can\'t make that the main platform. 40 per cent of the people vote for BJP, and 60 per cent of the people do not vote for BJP. He is everybody\'s Prime Minister and not a party\'s Prime Minister and that\'s the message the people of India want him to have. Talk about employment, talk about inflation, talk about science and technology and challenges. They (people) have to decide what are the real issues- is Ram Mandir the real issue? Or unemployment is a real issue. Is Ram Mandir the real issue or Inflation is a real issue?\n\nin another controversial comment in 2019, Sam Pitroda had said that that the taxes may go up a little bit if Nyuntam Aay Yojna (NYAY) is implemented. ""The middle class should not be selfish and have a \'big heart\',"" he had said.\n\nPM Modi had later blasted the Congress for Pitroda\'s remark. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had alleged that Congress wants to punish the middle class by imposing high taxes and take the country back to the ""licence raj"".\n\n""Congress and some other parties are pitching for higher taxes on middle class. I want to ask them whether they want to get the country back to the licence raj era when there was a tax regime of 70-80 per cent,"" Modi said during an election rally.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following a row, Shrinate removed the controversial remarks from all her social accounts, claiming that those were not posted by her but by someone else who had access to her accounts.\n\nThe Election Commission censured Shrinate for derogatory remarks against the dignity of women.\n\nRanaut claimed no BJP leader ever used such words for women and listed various initiatives of the Narendra Modi government for women\'s welfare.\n\nShe also accused Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu of not fulfilling his poll promises. He closed over 1,000 institutions and the development works which were on a fast track during the BJP rule have come to a standstill, the BJP candidate claimed.\n\nAfter paying tributes to Ambedkar on his birth anniversary, Ranaut said he had immense contribution towards the eradication of social evils but the Congress did not give due respect to him and other great patriots such as Subhash Chandra Bose, V D Savarkar and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.\n\nOn the contrary, Prime Minister Modi described all places associated with Ambedkar as pilgrimage sites, replaced the statue of a British monarch at the famed canopy of India Gate in Delhi with that of Subhash Chandra Bose and also honoured Sardar Patel by installing the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Vikramaditya Singh alleged that the BJP was spreading falsehood that the Congress is an ""anti-Hindu party"" and reiterated that Himachal Pradesh was the first state to bring an anti-conversion law during the tenure of then chief minister Virbhadra Singh, built Dev Sadan in Mandi and Kullu and started the system of giving ""nazrana"" to temples in Kullu.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addressing a rally in Ashok Nagar in Guna Lok Sabha seat earlier in the day, Adityanath claimed the Congress wants to give minorities all freedom to eat and drink as per their choice and then went on to link it to cow slaughter and beef consumption.\n\n""Are the food habits of minorities different from that of the majority (community? The general food habits are the same but the majority of society does not eat beef and opposes cow slaughter. Now Congress has stooped so low that it will support cow slaughter,"" the UP chief minister alleged.

325,325,"b'Thackeray criticizes BJP for involvement in Adarsh scam through Ashok Chavan\'s induction. He questions the disparity in security provision, highlighting the case of Parth Pawar. Thackeray alleges the government prioritizes security for traitors over common people.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday hit out the BJP, saying that by inducting former Congress leader Ashok Chavan, the ruling party has also become a part of the multi-crore Adarsh Housing Society scam now. Earlier, the BJP used to target Chavan saying the families of martyrs were fooled in the Adarsh scam, but now the same party is involved in fooling them, he alleged.\n\nThackeray was addressing a press conference at Nanded in Maharashtra, where he arrived to campaign for the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidate Vasant Chavan from the Nanded Lok Sabha constituency. Ashok Chavan, a former Maharashtra chief minister, is an accused in the Adarsh Housing Society scam wherein a 31-storey posh building in south Mumbai was constructed allegedly on land owned by the Defence Ministry without getting the requisite permissions and clearances.\n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2014 sought to delete Chavan\'s name from the case but this was rejected both by the special CBI court and later by the Bombay High Court in 2015. The matter is pending before the Supreme Court which in 2018 stayed proceedings in the case. Chavan joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in February this year and was elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha after being fielded by the party. At the time of joining the ruling party, Chavan termed the Adarsh case as a ""political mishap"" and said he considered it a ""non-issue"" now.\n\nThackeray said, ""The Adarsh scam case is yet to be decided by the court. Now, BJP has inducted Ashok Chavan into the party fold and made him a Rajya Sabha member. So this way, BJP is also involved in the Adarsh scam now."" ""There are videos (of BJP leaders) saying that Adarsh Society was formed and the families of martyrs were fooled. But after Chavan joined the BJP, he was also praised on stage,"" he said. Earlier the BJP leaders used to say that families of martyrs were fooled in the Adarsh scam, Thackeray said. ""Now it is my allegation that BJP is also involved in fooling the martyrs\' families,"" he said.\n\nThackeray also said that after Chavan quit the Congress, several new faces came up in the party. ""Congress has received a fresh fillip after Ashok Chavan\'s departure. The barriers in the path of new leaders are now gone. The \'subhedari\' in our party also crumbled,"" he said, apparently referring to the Eknath Shinde-led camp. On the state government\'s decision to provide a Y-plus security cover to Parth Pawar, the son of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, the Sena (UBT) president said, ""I have heard that rocket launchers and tanks are also being deployed for his security.\n\nPeople working at the residences of those who betrayed are being provided security, but common people are not secure. Firing took place in front of actor Salman Khan\'s residence."" ""But the people who are with them (those in power) are given security. Who is paying for their security is the question.

PM Modi warned that such policies could sow communal disharmony by targeting certain communities and discourage economic growth.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has castigated the Congress\' plan of wealth redistribution as a dangerous idea, in an interview with TOI yesterday.\n\nEarly this month, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi promised that if the Congress is voted to power, the party would conduct a survey to run a check on who possesses the wealth in the country and undertake an exercise to redistribute the same. ""First, we will conduct a caste census to know the exact population and status of backward castes, SCs, STs, minorities and other castes. After that, the financial and institutional survey will begin. Subsequently, we will take up the historic assignment to distribute the wealth of India, jobs and other welfare schemes to these sections based on their population,"" Rahul said.\n\nAlso Read: PM adds fuel to Cong\'s redistribution row, says party will eye properties of others but not of Waqf board, minorities\n\nThe idea turned into a big controversy when PM Modi suggested in a campaign speech that if the Congress comes to power, it would redistribute wealth of people to Muslims and cited former PM Manmohan Singh\'s remark that the minority community had the first claim on the country\'s resources. ""This urban-naxal mindset, my mothers and sisters, they will not even leave your \'mangalsutra\'. They can go to that level,"" Modi said addressing a rally in Rajasthan\'s Banswara.\n\nUS-based Congress leader Sam Pitroda fuelled the controversy by proposing inheritance tax as a way to redistribute wealth. """"In America, there is an inheritance tax. If one has $100 million worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer probably 45% to his children, 55% is grabbed by the government. That\'s an interesting law,"" he said. He later said he was just giving an example. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that Pitroda\'s comments do not reflect the party\'s position.\n\nIn an interview to TOI yesterday, Modi analysed the Congress\' controversial idea in detail, calling it a ""Maoist"" idea. ""We should not consider this sinister plan of the Congress party like an idle threat. The threat is very real and stands to hurt our nation irreversibly. This is a clear example of Maoist thinking and ideology. It is saddening to see the Congress party and its Yuvraj carrying forward such Maoist vision which is a recipe for disaster. You would have seen the Yuvraj saying that we will do an X-ray. This X-ray is nothing but raiding every home. They will raid farmers to see how much land they possess. They will raid the common man to see how much wealth he/she has earned through hard work. They will raid the ornaments of our women. Our Constitution protects the property of all minorities. This means that when Congress talks of redistribution, it cannot touch the properties of minorities, it cannot consider waqf properties for redistribution but it will eye the properties of other communities. This will sow complete and irreversible communal disharmony,"" he said.\n\nRead the full interview: \'India does not become an electoral autocracy if Yuvraj cannot get power\': PM Modi\n\nPM Modi said ideas of wealth redistribution, wealth tax, etc, are never successful because they never remove poverty, but just distribute it so that everyone is equally poor. ""These are actually dangerous problems disguised as solutions. Would you work day and night if the government will take away your money in the name of redistribution?"" he said.\n\nPM Modi said wealth redistribution will discourage a large number of people who are coming out of poverty with the government\'s help.\n\n""Today, we are empowering 3 crore women to become Lakhpati Didis. Such policies will ensure that women don\'t become Lakhpatis and their aspirations don\'t progress. If someone has taken a Mudra loan and is progressing, his growth will be stunted.

""This unleashes their entrepreneurial potential as we have seen in our country; even in tier 2 and 3 cities, which are giving rise to a lot of startups and sports stars,"" he said.\n\n""These reasons are why wealth redistribution, wealth tax, etc have never been successful: they never removed poverty; they just distributed it so that everyone is equally poor.

338,338,"b'A peculiar poll battle is on the cards in the tribal-dominated Banswara-Dungarpur Lok Sabha constituency in Rajasthan where the Congress is appealing to the people not to vote for its candidate. The reason: After much flip-flop, the Congress decided to support Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) candidate Rajkumar Roat -- a day before the last date of withdrawal of nominations -- despite fielding its own candidate Arvind Damor.\n\nIn accordance with the party\'s announcement to support the BAP, Damor was supposed to withdraw his nomination papers but he was nowhere to be seen till the last date of withdrawal of nominations was over. Later, appearing before the media, Damor feigned ignorance about the developments and declared that he would contest the election.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a bipolar contest between the BJP and the Congress-BAP alliance has turned into a three-way fight with Damor likely to divide the Congress votes thus, giving an edge to the saffron party candidate -- Mahendrajit Singh Malviya.\n\nWhile the local leadership of the Congress has appealed to the people to vote for Roat instead of their own candidate, Damor has claimed that he has the support of a section of the party leaders who are against the alliance with the BAP.\n\nVikas Bamnia, a district-level leader, and the son of Congress MLA Arjun Bamnia said the party was supporting Roat.\n\n""Our stand is clear, we are supporting the BAP candidate. We are working keeping in mind the sentiments of the people and the directions received from the party,"" Bamnia said.\n\nAnother local Congress leader said, ""We are asking people clearly to not vote for the Congress candidate (Damor).""\n\nAlthough several local residents told PTI that the contest was primarily between Malviya and Roat, some were of the view that Damor\'s refusal to toe the party line was embarrassing for the Congress.\n\nBAP, which was established in southern Rajasthan ahead of the 2023 assembly elections, has three MLAs, including Roat.\n\nBanswara-Dungarpur is a reserved seat for Scheduled Tribes and will go to polls in the second phase of Lok Sabha elections on Friday.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a rally here on Sunday.\n\nSlamming the Congress manifesto, he had alleged that the opposition party was planning to give people\'s hard-earned money to ""infiltrators"" and ""those who have more children"" and referred to former PM Manmohan Singh\'s speech in 2006 to contend he had said that Muslims have the ""first claim"" on the country\'s resources.\n\nIn his campaigning speeches, Malviya has accused Roat of misleading the people of Banswara while he, in return, has been charged with dividing the tribal community by the Congress-BAP candidate.\n\n""Where will these people take our tribal brothers and sisters? They are misleading the tribal community. Building a house for one person does not benefit the entire community,"" Malviya, who joined the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, said.\n\n""These people are working to spread anarchy. No matter how much they try, the BJP is going to win this seat by lakhs of votes. The alliance of Congress and BAP will not work. It only shows that the Congress did not get a candidate for the Banswara-Dungarpur seat,"" he added.\n\nCountering him, Raot said the BJP candidate was ""dividing"" and abusing the tribal community.\n\n""The kind of statements Malviya is giving... he is abusing the tribal community. The BJP is trying to divide the tribal community. Our tribal people may be associated with any party, be it the BJP or the Congress, but it is our responsibility to unite them. We think above the party, we think for the tribal people,"" he said.\n\nDamor, meanwhile, said a faction of the Congress leaders was against the alliance with BAP.\n\n""I have support from the people and the party leaders who are not in favour of the alliance. I am confident of winning the election,"" Damor said.\n\nFormer BJP state president Satish Poonia, who campaigned in the constituency in support of Malviya, said that Congress was nowhere in the scene.\n\n""The condition of Congress leaders has become such that when they went to a \'bhandara\', the \'prasad\' was over and when they came out, their shoes and slippers were missing,"" he said.\n\nAmid the tussle, key issues like education, employment, roads and electricity have taken a back seat with each candidate trying to outdo the other to project himself as the champion of the tribal community, according to some non-tribal locals.\n\n""The area lacks industries and job opportunities. Many people from this region work in the neighbouring state of Gujarat. Women are also seen working in farms and in labour work in large numbers,"" a non-tribal local resident said.\n\n""The ideology of BAP appears to be radical and could emerge as a threat in the time to come. Issues are less important, they are polarising people in the name of the community,"" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the need for the Congress to find an alliance partner in Banswara-Dungarpur was necessitated after Malviya -- a satrap from the Vagad region -- joined the BJP.\n\nMalviya, who was made a cabinet minister twice in the previous Congress governments, quit the party after being denied the post of the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly in the wake of the Congress\' defeat in the 2023 assembly elections.\n\nHe resigned as the MLA from Bagidora assembly constituency and joined the BJP in February.\n\nAs the Congress and the BAP -- the new party from the Vagad region -- held discussions for an alliance, the lack of consensus on seat sharing and resistance by some local Congress leaders delayed the finalisation of the coalition. On the last day of filing of nominations, the Congress decided to field Damor from Banswara-Dungarpur and Kapoor Singh from Bagidora for the bypoll.\n\nA day before the withdrawal of nominations, Rajasthan Congress in charge Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa announced on social media that the party would support BAP in both elections.\n\nHowever, in a rude shock for the Congress, its two candidates refused to withdraw their nominations.\n\nOf the eight assembly segments under the Banswara-Dungarpur Lok Sabha seat, the BJP has four MLAs, the Congress has three and the BAP one.\n\nThe Congress in Rajasthan is contesting the elections as part of an alliance on two seats -- Nagaur (with Rashtriya Loktantrik Party) and Sikar (with CPI-M).'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in 1989, Digvijaya lost from Rajgarh to the BJP\'s Pyarelal Khandelwal. In 1989, the BJP was part of the Janata Dal coalition led by VP Singh that defeated the Congress at the Centre.\n\nWith the Janata Dal coalition government soon collapsing, Digvijaya won the seat back in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections. When he returned back to state politics for a 10-year stint as CM, his brother Laxman Singh won the seat the next five times for the Congress.\n\nDigvijaya Singh currently serves as a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha and is a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee, the party\'s highest decision-making body.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he contested from Bhopal but lost to BJP candidate Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur by over 3.6 lakh votes.\n\nWhile Digvijaya has himself been out of electoral politics in the state since his CM spell from 1993 to 2003, he has always been a prime target for the BJP.\n\nUnion Minister Amit Shah who held a public rally in Rajgarh last month to drum up the support for the BJP\'s candidate took a dig at Singh and asked the gathering to give the latter\'s political career a ""grand farewell"".\n\nShah recited the Urdu couplet ""aashiq ka janaaza hai, zara dhoom se nikle"" (it is a lover\'s funeral procession, let it move ahead grandly) to take a swipe at Singh.\n\nHe also slammed Rahul Gandhi and Digvijaya Singh for declining the invitation to attend the consecration of Ram Lalla\'s idol in Ayodhya, saying their move was guided purely by vote-bank politics.\n\n""Do you know why shehzada Rahul Gandhi and Diggi Raja (Digvijaya Singh) did not attend the consecration of Ram Lalla\'s idol at Ayodhya? Because they are afraid of their vote-bank and therefore, they should never be pardoned,"" he noted.\n\nMeanwhile, Rajgarh has been slipping away from the Congress, even as Laxman Singh\'s own loyalties have swung between the party and BJP.\n\nThe 2023 Assembly elections too did not go the Congress\'s way in Rajgarh. Of the eight Assembly segments falling under the Rajgarh Lok Sabha constituency - Chachoura, Raghogarh, Narsinghgarh, Biaora, Rajgarh, Khilchipur, Sarangpur (SC) and Susner - the Congress only won Raghogarh, where Digvijaya\'s son and heir Jaivardhan was the candidate.\n\nIn the last two general elections, 2014 and 2019, the constituency was won by the BJP\'s MP Rodmal Nagar.\n\nNagar first got the ticket in 2014 and then retained it in 2019 despite local BJP opposition. In 2019, Nagar won against Congress candidate Mona Sustby 4.31 lakh votes (a vote share of 65.37 per cent).\n\nRajgarh will go to polls on May 7 in phase three of the seven-phased ensuing general elections.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BJP and AAP saw the resignation differently, with BJP predicting more turmoil in Congress.The resignation of Congress\' Delhi unit chief Arvinder Singh Lovely in protest against the alliance with AAP brought the party\'s factional feud into the open, with a section of leaders on Sunday demanding the removal of AICC in-charge Deepak Babaria. While the Aam Aadmi Party termed it as an internal matter of the Congress, the BJP said Lovely has listened to the voice of his conscience as no patriot can stand with those who talk about dividing the country and claimed there would be further repercussions for the Congress.\n\nIn his resignation letter to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Lovely said the Delhi Congress unit was against the alliance with AAP and that all unanimous decisions taken by the senior Delhi unit leaders have been ""unilaterally vetoed"" by Babaria.\n\nSome party workers gathered outside Lovely\'s residence and raised slogans against AICC\'s Delhi in-charge Babaria who, meanwhile, stressed that all DPCC leaders were taken into confidence on the alliance issue and Lovely should have aired his views before the party panels.\n\n""Ahead of forming the alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, the DPCC leaders and workers were taken into confidence.\n\n""He (Lovely) was part of all the committees and panels; he should have raised his objections back then. Anyone who distances themselves from any party or posts tends to find a reason to do so,"" Babaria told reporters.\n\nA scuffle broke outside Lovely\'s residence here as his supporters allegedly pushed ex-Congress MLA Asid Mohammed Khan who had reached there after Lovely\'s resignation.\n\nKhan said, ""This was an internal matter and Lovely should have reached out to the Congress president. By releasing his resignation letter in the media, he is providing an advantage to the BJP.""\n\nHe alleged that BJP will replace its East Delhi candidate Harsh Malhotra and Lovely will be declared by the party as its candidate from the constituency.\n\nAt a press conference later, Lovely made it clear that he has only resigned from the party post and is not joining any political party.\n\nIn his resignation letter, he also said that tickets were given to two people who are total strangers to the Delhi Congress and party policies while referring to the candidature of Kanhaiya Kumar from Northeast Delhi and Udit Raj from Northwest Delhi constituencies.\n\nLovely also criticised Kanhaiya Kumar for heaping praise on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is behind bars in a money laundering case.\n\nWhen asked about the development, Kumar said, ""I don\'t know. I don\'t have any information. Let me gather the information from the party and then I will tell you.""\n\nDelhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said that Lovely has responded to the voice of his conscience and the implosion within the Congress started the moment the party announced its Lok Sabha candidates.\n\n""No patriot can stand with a person who talks about dividing the country and who stands with the enemies of the nation. I think this line will be drawn further as many others are raising their voice against the way the Congress has distributed its tickets,"" he said.\n\nFormer Delhi minister Rajkumar Chauhan, who resigned from the party on Wednesday, said Babaria should be removed as the AICC in-charge of Delhi.\n\n""Lovely has resigned. I have also resigned. The Delhi in-charge told me to get out of a meeting. Remove Delhi in-charge Deepak Babaria from Delhi and save Congress,"" Chauhan said.\n\nCongress leader Sandeep Dikshit, the son of former chief minister Sheila Dikshit, said, ""He is pained. There is a personal pain as a Congress worker and as Delhi Congress\'\' chief. I think attention needs to be paid to what he said.""\n\nFormer Congress MLA Neeraj Basoya said, ""Lovely has resigned after seeing the sentiments of the Congress workers. Babaria\'s style of functioning has created problems everywhere, be it Delhi or Haryana, and all the workers are angry.""\n\nAAP senior leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said it was an internal matter of their senior ally Congress.\n\n""It won\'t be appropriate for me to comment on the matter. AAP is fighting on the four seats it is contesting with full strength and we are hopeful that people will vote for the INDIA bloc candidates on all the seven seats in Delhi,"" he said.\n\nSenior BJP leader and former Union Minister Harsh Vardhan said it was inevitable as the grassroots workers had not accepted the AAP-Congress alliance.\n\n""I guarantee that after their defeat on June 4, the leaders of this alliance will start abusing each other again. Arvinder Lovely Ji\'s departure is just the beginning. The conscience of many such grassroots workers will awaken now,"" he wrote on X in Hindi.\n\nCongress leader Surendra Rajput said Kharge will decide the future course of action after Lovely\'s resignation.\n\n""I would only say that our alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party happened with his participation and as per his wish. The general elections are going on and one should keep personal expectations and aspirations aside for now,"" he said.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

364,364,"b'In the high-stakes Kadapa parliamentary race, Congress leader Y S Sharmila Reddy is rallying voters, invoking her father\'s legacy, the iconic Y S Rajasekhara Reddy. Campaigning amidst cheers and recorded voices of her late father, Sharmila accuses her cousin, Avinash Reddy, of murder, contrasting herself as the true heir to YSR\'s ideals. With a focus on women voters and strategic jabs at her brother and BJP ties, Sharmila aims to reclaim Kadapa\'s Congress stronghold, leveraging her father\'s enduring appeal in the May 13 polls.In the high-stakes battle for the Kadapa parliamentary constituency, Congress leader Y S Sharmila Reddy is leaving no stone unturned to woo voters by invoking the political legacy and popularity of her late father, the iconic Y S Rajasekhara Reddy (YSR), the former Chief Minister of united Andhra Pradesh. Sharmila, who merged her party into the Congress ahead of elections, is taking on her cousin Avinash Reddy, the YSR Congress candidate accused in the murder case of their uncle and the party\'s senior leader, Y S Vivekananda Reddy.\n\nAs Sharmila campaigns in the bylanes and streets of Proddatur, one of the seven assembly segments under the Kadapa Lok Sabha seat, crowds swell to cheer the state Congress president when they hear the recorded voice of her father, who tragically died in a helicopter crash in September 2009.\n\n""Namaste amma (mother), akka (sister), and paapa (child). Namaste, namaste to all,"" the former CM\'s voice greets the crowds, especially in the Muslim-dominated Jinha Road area. After the recorded voice stops, the party\'s election song ""O Sharmila, O Sharmila"" plays like a Tollywood hit, sending the gathering into a frenzy.\n\nStanding atop an open vehicle adorned with party posters, Sharmila addresses the gatherings, repeating the lyrics of her election song, suggesting she was introduced to politics like a sword forged in fire. ""I am the daughter of Dr Rajasekhara Reddy. Vote for me, make me victorious,"" she urges as the crowd in Darga Bazaar cheers.\n\nSharmila accuses her opponent, Avinash Reddy, of being involved in the murder of her uncle and YSR Congress leader Vivekananda Reddy.\n\n""The CBI has named Avinash Reddy as an accused, but he is my opposing candidate. You should decide if you will vote for someone accused of murder or for me, the daughter of Rajasekhara Reddy, who always fought for the rights of the people,"" she tells the crowd.\n\nAs her vehicle passes through another street of Proddatur, Sharmila occasionally waves and says ""Namaste"" to a large number of women voters, some burka-clad, while moving through the narrow streets.\n\nAt one stop, after her father\'s recorded voice greets the crowd, she takes a dig at her brother, Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, the incumbent Chief Minister, accusing him of aligning with the BJP and TDP chief and former CM Chandrababu Naidu.\n\nSharmila again takes the mic and says, ""This morning, I gifted a mirror to my brother to see his face in it and asked him if he saw himself or TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu, who he has been claiming is funding my election and the campaign. He is obsessed with Naidu.""\n\n""I would like to tell you all that you should vote for Congress as this is the only party that is looking for change. Both Naidu and my brother Jagan are aligned with the BJP, so whoever you vote for will ultimately benefit the BJP. If you want to vote against the BJP, then you should vote for Congress,"" she adds.\n\nAgain, her father\'s voice comes on, a well-thought strategy to re-establish a deep connect with the people who have not yet forgotten their poor and farmer-friendly leader. It\'s a voice that was recorded in the 2004 campaign. The iconic leader Rajasekhara Reddy is no more, but his voice lives on.\n\nAs the dusk falls, Sharmila winds up her campaign appealing people to bless her and vote for Congress on May 13 polling day.\n\nSharmila has already covered all seven constituencies falling under the Kadapa parliamentary segment once.\n\nThe Congress is contesting 23 out of the 25 parliamentary seats in Andhra Pradesh, while its allies, the CPI and CPM, are contesting one seat each as part of the India bloc.\n\nFor the 175 state assembly elections, the Congress has fielded candidates from 157 constituencies, while the CPI, CPM, and CPI (ML) are contesting the remaining seats as part of the India bloc.\n\nSharmila\'s campaign in the high-stakes Kadapa battle is a calculated effort to leverage her father\'s enduring popularity and project herself as the rightful custodian of his political legacy.\n\nHer strategy involves capitalising on Reddy\'s voice recordings to forge an emotional connect with the people, while simultaneously positioning the BJP, which she accuses her brother and Naidu of aligning with, as the main opponent to rally against.\n\nThere are about 17 lakh electors in Kadapa Lok Sabha segment, dominated by women voters of about 9 lakh. This constituency remained a Congress bastion till YSR Congress emerged victorious in 2014.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The central agency on Monday arrested Sanjeev Kumar Lal, 52, and his domestic help Jahangir Alam, 42, following searches that led to the seizure Rs 32.20 crore cash from a flat in the Jharkhand capital where the latter was residing.\n\nLal, the secretary of rural development minister and Congress leader Alamgir Alam, and Jahangir Alam were produced before the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court of Prabhat Kumar Sharma here. The court sent them to six days of ED custody.\n\nThe seizure was made by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) as part of a money laundering investigation linked to the rural development department.\n\nThe total seizure of cash by the ED in the case has been recorded at around Rs 36.75 crore as the agency seized about Rs 3 crore from another location that included Rs 10.05 lakh from Lal\'s place. Rs 1.50 crore was also seized from a contractor\'s premises on Tuesday.\n\nAlamgir Alam, 70, has distanced himself from the activities of Lal. Talking to reporters here on Monday the minister said Lal had earlier served with other ministers of the state government too.\n\nDuring the BJP\'s poll campaign in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his speeches has also mentioned about the cash seizure. Opposition parties have, however, claimed that the ED action was an assault against its leaders.\n\nIn its remand papers submitted in court to seek the custody of Lal and Jahangir Alam for interrogation, the ED said,""It is ascertained that Sanjeev Lal takes care of the collection of commission on behalf of some influential persons and plays a pivotal role in managing the tenders and collection of commission from engineers, also the said percentage of commission is distributed in a mechanised manner to higher-ups of the government.""\n\nNames of ""senior bureaucrats and politicians"" have emerged in the case and this is being investigated, the agency said.\n\n""It is submitted that several officials, from top to bottom, of the rural development department are involved in this nexus and huge payments were usually received in cash which were later laundered which needs to be unearthed,"" the ED said.\n\nThe ED sought their custody from the court, saying that they were ""deliberately withholding"" information regarding the source of funds seized from them.\n\nTheir custody is also required to investigate the role of other beneficiaries, including senior government functionaries who ""abused"" their position and ""acquired"" the proceeds of crime through the two in respect of allocation of tender, the agency said.\n\nThe agency said Jahangir Alam was ""in the possession"" of the proceeds of crime ""on the instructions"" of Lal which he collected on behalf of ""some influential persons"".\n\nIt claimed that the Lal and Jahangir Alam acquired illicit money through ""criminal activity and concealed the said cash at different places"".\n\nTwo vehicles, the ED told the court, registered in the name of Jahangir Alam were found on the premises that it raided on Monday. These were found to be ""under the use"" of Lal, it said.\n\nThe ED claimed that Jahangir Alam said in his statement to it that one of these vehicles was ""funded"" by Lal. This ""clearly establishes"" their nexus, it added.\n\nThe money laundering case of September 2020 is based on a Jharkhand Police anti-corruption branch (Jamshedpur) case and a March 2023 FIR filed by the economic offences wing of the Delhi Police against former chief engineer of the state rural works department Veerendra Kumar Ram and some others.\n\nRam was arrested by the ED last year.\n\nThe former chief engineer was with the water resource department of the Jharkhand government and was sent on deputation to the rural development and works department (special division).\n\nRam, according to the ED, used to ""collect commissions"" in terms of allocation of tender and execution of work and the said commission of 1.5 per cent was ""distributed"" among his seniors and politicians.\n\nIt was alleged by the ED before the court that one such commission was handed over by Ram to Lal in September 2022.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AI and AI-generated fakes, or deepfakes, are being increasingly used in elections elsewhere in the world, including in the U.S., Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nCampaigning in India has long focused on door-to-door outreach and public rallies, but extensive use of WhatsApp and Facebook as campaigning tools started in 2019.

According to Irani, Gandhi sought support from PFI during his Lok Sabha election campaign in Wayanad, Kerala, where he currently holds parliamentary office.\n\nIrani, addressing reporters, accused Gandhi of disrespecting the constituents of Amethi, a seat previously held by the Congress but now represented by Irani herself. She stated, ""We have received this information that Rahul Gandhi took the support of terrorist organization PFI to contest his election in Wayanad.""\n\nIrani continued, pointing to the chargesheet filed against PFI, alleging the organization\'s involvement in planning violence against Hindus. She called upon Gandhi to explain his association with an organization linked to such activities, asserting that it reflected poorly on his respect for Amethi\'s voters. ""He insulted Amethi. PM Narendra Modi developed Amethi and the people of Amethi will bless PM Narendra Modi,"" she added.\n\nWhile Irani is set to seek re-election from Amethi under the BJP banner, the Congress has yet to announce its candidate for the constituency. Notably, Gandhi lost to Irani in the 2019 general elections.\n\nIrani further emphasized the anticipation surrounding the Gandhi family\'s potential return to Amethi for electoral contests. She highlighted Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s welfare initiatives in the region, questioning the Gandhi family\'s stance against such development efforts.\n\nRecent developments suggest a triangular contest in Wayanad, where Rahul Gandhi faces tough competition, notably from CPI\'s Annie Raja. Despite being allies in the opposition INDIA bloc, the CPI and Congress engage in fierce competition in Kerala.\n\nIn a bid to strengthen its position in the upcoming 2024 elections, the BJP has nominated Kerala State President K Surendran as its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate from the constituency.\n\nKerala remains a stronghold for the Congress, with the state sending 20 parliamentarians to the Lok Sabha. In the 2019 polls, Rahul Gandhi secured victory in Wayanad with a significant margin, garnering 64.94% of the vote share.\n\nAs Kerala braces for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections scheduled for April 26, political dynamics continue to evolve, with parties vying for dominance in the region. The results of these elections, set to be announced on June 4, will undoubtedly shape the political landscape of Kerala and beyond.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
388,388,"b'The Congress accused the BJP of neglecting Maharashtra, alleging it was preoccupied with ""horse-trading and deal-making."" Jairam Ramesh criticized the BJP ahead of PM Modi\'s rally, questioning its support for farmers amidst rising suicides and drought. Ramesh highlighted issues like delayed aid for farmers and suspicious ambulance service tenders, urging clarity on the BJP\'s vision.The Congress on Wednesday alleged that the BJP has neglected the people of Maharashtra as it was distracted by its own ""horse-trading and deal-making"" agendas, and asked how much donation did it take to engineer the collapse of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh attacked the BJP ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s rally in Maharashtra\'s Ramtek and posed questions on key issues affecting the state.\n\n""Today, the PM heads to Ramtek in Maharashtra, a state that was rocked by hundreds of farmer suicides last year, and where corruption charges continue to pile up. Distracted by its own horse-trading and deal-making agendas, the BJP has neglected to serve the people,"" Ramesh said in a post on X.\n\nPosing questions to the prime minister, the Congress leader said that on an average day in Maharashtra, seven farmers take their own lives, and this heartbreaking statistic comes from the state\'s Minister for Relief and Rehabilitation, who reported that 2,366 farmers died by suicide between January and October last year.\n\n""He was quick to remind us that \'The state government gives 1 lakh rupees to the kin of farmers who die by suicide\'. What the Minister did not reveal is the callousness from the government that compels farmers to take such drastic steps in the first place,"" he said.\n\nRamesh claimed that 60 per cent of districts faced drought conditions last year but no help arrived from the government.\n\n""When crops were damaged by unseasonal rains in more than half of the state, farmers were extended loan waivers, but 6.56 lakh farmers were deprived of this relief due to software glitches. In the face of this state-sponsored callousness, the Congress Nyay Patra has guaranteed farmers MSP as per the Swaminathan Committee\'s recommendation, a farm loan waiver with a permanent commission set up to implement it smoothly, and settlement of all crop insurance claims within 30 days,"" he said.\n\nWhat is the BJP\'s vision to support Maharashtra\'s and India\'s farmers, Ramesh asked.\n\nHe said that on January 4, the Joint Director of Health Services (procurement cell) in Mumbai floated a ""suspicious"" tender for the state\'s ambulance services.\n\nThis tender was first floated in September 2023, and then mysteriously scrapped, he added.\n\n""The latest bid was floated with a notice period of just seven days, was a ten-year long contract, and carried a massive Rs 8,000 crore price tag. Despite initial interest from over 30 companies, eventually only one bidder emerged, and the final contract is expected to exceed 10,000 crores by 2034,"" he said.\n\n""Many questions have been raised about this opaque process. Why wasn\'t the bidding process for the new contract started sooner than January 4th, given that the old contract was about to end on Jan 31st? Why was the state unable to carry out a forensic audit of the service\'s performance between 2014 and 2024?\n\n""Why is the operational cost for ambulances so high? If the government is willing to make such a large outlay, why are ambulance services being outsourced, unlike other states where the government owns the vehicles? Is this another tender that the BJP was planning to award to one of its cronies in return for some Electoral Bonds Chanda?"" he said.\n\nRamesh said that Maharashtra\'s 2022 political crisis showed the nation that the BJP\'s ""greed for power"" is much greater than its regard for democratic values.\n\nThey did not hesitate to use their ill-gotten electoral bonds donation to buy Shiv Sena and NCP MLAs, and have destroyed Maharashtra\'s political culture in the process, he alleged.\n\n""We now know that the electoral bonds scam cost Indian citizens Rs 4 lakh crore. The question is how much chanda did it take to engineer the collapse of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Sarkar? And what price did the people of India have to pay to keep the BJP\'s horse-trading coffers full?"" Ramesh said and asked the prime minister to break his silence on these issues.\n\nThe MVA came into being after the Uddhav Thackeray-led undivided Shiv Sena fell out with the BJP in 2019 and joined hands with the Congress and undivided NCP to form a government in the state.\n\nThe MVA government was, however, toppled when Eknath Shinde and several other Sena MLAs rebelled against Thackeray, and the alliance suffered another blow last year when Ajit Pawar split the NCP and joined the Shinde-led government.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
389,389,"b'Ever since the inheritance tax was abolished in 1985, it keeps hitting the news from time to time. Many times it is speculated before the presentation of the Union budget if the finance minister would re-impose the inheritance tax. Many countries impose inheritance tax in different ways. Pitroda\'s comments have brought it back into the discussion again.Right after the controversy over Rahul Gandhi\'s promise to conduct a financial and institutional survey to ascertain who is in possession of the wealth of the country, and then undertake an exercise to redistribute the wealth, another senior leader, Sam Pitroda, Chairman of Indian Overseas Congress, has stoked it further.\n\nPitroda proposed inheritance tax as a way to redistribute wealth. ""In America, there is an inheritance tax. If one has $100 million worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer probably 45% to his children, 55% is grabbed by the government. That\'s an interesting law,"" he said. He later said he was just giving an example. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that Pitroda\'s comments do not reflect the party\'s position.\n\nEver since the inheritance tax was abolished in 1985, it keeps hitting the news from time to time. Many times it is speculated before the presentation of the Union budget if the finance minister would re-impose the inheritance tax. Many countries impose inheritance tax in different ways. Contrary to what Pitroda said, the US government does not impose any inheritance tax but only six states do (and one of them is abolishing it next year) and the tax rate varies from 1% to 20%, There are several big exemptions for close relatives and family-owned businesses and also loopholes that can be exploited to avoid the tax.\n\nA dysfunctional tax?\n\nExemptions, carve-outs and generous lifetime donations mean inheritance and estate tax is a minor source of revenue in most countries and often make inequality worse, a study by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) had said a few years ago.\n\nAmong the worst offenders is the United States, where only 0.2% of estates pay inheritance tax while nearly 80% of the wealth is in the hands of the top 10% richest households. Inheritance or estate tax make up only 0.5% of overall tax revenues on average across the 24 countries in the OECD group of mostly developed countries that have such levies.\n\nThe OECD said a majority of estates escaped tax altogether in some countries because of generous exemptions for close relatives and assets such as family-owned businesses.\n\nPolicies varied widely among OECD countries, with exemptions on transfers to children ranging from $17,000 in the Brussels region of Belgium to $11 million in the United States. Heirs\' tax bills could be avoided or reduced in some countries thanks to in-life gifts that often get more favourable tax treatment, the study said. As a result, the effective tax rates paid are often significantly lower than statutory tax rates. In the United States and Britain, the wealthiest households were taxed at lower rates than other wealthy donors.\n\nIndia\'s inheritance tax was repealed in 1985 because it neither helped bring down economic inequality in society nor did it contribute significantly to the exchequer. In 1984-85, the total tax collected under the Estate Duty Act was Rs 20 crore, but the cost of collection was very high because the complex calculation structure spawned a lot of litigation.\n\nIndia levied an inheritance tax between 1953 and 1985. A glance at the budget documents for the early 1980s reveals GoI collected only Rs 2-4 crore in revenue from the tax every year, amounting to about 0.02% of all tax revenue, as per Jay Vinayak Ojha, a project fellow at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, ""If applied to figures for 2022-23, this would mean a revenue of about Rs 600 cr. For comparison, it costs over Rs 10,000 cr a year to collect direct taxes. Even if the addition of this complex tax did not add to this expenditure, all the revenue generated from it wouldn\'t even keep its administrators going for a month,"" Ojha has said.\n\nWhy inheritance tax doesn\'t come up to its promise\n\nWhile ostensibly inheritance tax makes sense since it is levied only on the super rich and promises large collections, in reality it fails to come up to its promise. Many experts think inheritance tax in India at this stage is a bad idea.\n\nRupesh Satnaliwala, MD and CEO, Universal Trustees, had told ET a few years ago that the developed countries which impose inheritance tax have a structured social security and retirement plans in place unlike in India. ""India is a developing country and still has a long way to go to become a developed economy. We struggle with basic infrastructure issues in India. At the current juncture, we need to keep incentivising entrepreneurial spirit so that more private investment happens, leading to employment and allied opportunities,"" he said.\n\nMoreover, such a tax can lead to the exodus of the high net worth individual to countries without this tax. These rich individuals will not only take their money out of India but also their entrepreneurial skills which India needs so much when it aims to consistently grow at higher rates.\n\nIt is not difficult to dodge the inheritance tax. When in 2017 the buzz about reimposition of inheritance tax started, the rich started devising novel methods to dodge the tax. One such method is forming a family trust which insulates their assets. Family trusts would fall outside the scope of inheritance tax -- if it is introduced -- because there is no transfer in ownership of assets, only a change in the trust shareholding.\n\nThe tax also entails some practical problems. Levied on the value of the deceased\'s assets and paid by their heir, the tax can translate into a sudden huge financial burden for the heir. When a property that has appreciated several times over decades gets passed down to the heir, the heir might have to sell the property to generate the amount he would be required to pay as tax on the property. Also, it may be very difficult to assess the value of some inherited assets such as family antiques. Ojha cites a famous tax dispute in which the US Internal Revenue Service insisted that rights to Michael Jackson\'s \'image and likeness\' were worth over $400 mn, and that his heirs owed the government hundreds of millions. However, a tax court found the real value was around $4 mn.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no comparison in the last 75 years to utterances of the PM in this Lok Sabha poll campaign, but all these attempts are bound to fail, he said.\n\n""They reflect the desperation of the BJP. It is not cultured or fair. It is false and it is not anywhere near the democratic ethos of India,"" he said. Singhvi also criticised the Election Commission of India for giving a notice to the BJP president on the Congress complaint to the poll body against the PM for his statement.""This is a complaint against an individual. What is the use of giving notice to another person,"" the Congress leader questioned.\n\nHe also alleged ""vitamin M (an apparent reference to money) was being used to lure leaders into the BJP and cited happenings in the Surat Lok Sabha poll (where the BJP candidate won unopposed), the Chandigarh mayoral elections and the Himachal Pradesh Rajya Sabha polls. ""You will be surprised to know that almost one-fourth of BJP candidates are from other parties.\n\nOut of 417 candidates announced by BJP, 116 are dalbadlu (turncoats). Of course most of them are from Congress,"" Singhvi said. Central probe agencies are being misused against opposition parties and 99.5 per cent political cases being pursued by them are against opposition members, he claimed. ""The BJP has a washing machine. If any of the accused joins that party they get a clean chit,"" he jibed.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

404,404,"b'Akola, April 23: A triangular contest is on the cards in the BJP stronghold of Akola where the altered political landscape and Congress\' strategy to field a Maratha candidate may dent the prospects of the saffron nominee pitted against B R Ambedkar\'s grandson Prakash Ambedkar, trying a comeback.\n\nThe Congress, a constituent of the Maha Vikas Aghadi, has given a ticket to Dr Abhay Patil, a Maratha, unlike in in 2014 and 2019 when the party had fielded a Muslim nominee- Hidayatulla Patel. The erstwhile bastion of Congress, Akola constituency in west Vidarbha had sent a heavyweight leader like Vasant Sathe to Lok Sabha, who had served as a Union minister in 1980-82.\n\nThe BJP breached this Congress citadel in 1989 with the party leader Pandurang Fundkar winning the contest. Barring 1996 and 1999, when Prakash Ambedkar was elected as MP from Akola, the BJP has retained its stronghold on the constituency, located in west Vidarbha.\n\nFive constituencies in the Vidarbha region, including Akola, will go on polls on April 26. The BJP has fielded Anup Dhotre, son of sitting MP Sanjay Dhotre who won the seat in 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. Maharashtra Lok Sabha Elections 2024: MVA Announces Seat-Sharing in State; Congress To Contest 17 Lok Sabha Seats, Shiv Sena (UBT) 21.\n\nPolitical observers believe that factors like changed caste dynamics with the entry of Dr Abhay Patil, a Maratha, and reorganised political alliances in Maharashtra may dent the BJP\'s prospects this time. However, a BJP leader claimed the party will not only emerge victorious again but will also increase its vote share as he highlighted welfare schemes of the Central government and various works done by sitting MP Sanjay Dhotre. Referring to the splits in Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray and NCP led by Sharad Pawar, senior Congress leader and former minister Azhar Hussain said there is a wave in favour of MVA in Vidarbha. ""The Congress has fielded a good candidate (Dr Abhay Patil) with a clean image and good public connect,"" he said. Hussain claimed ""Hindutva"" votes will shift to Congress as Shiv Sena (UBT) is working in alliance with the Grand Old Party and the Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar). He said NCP workers from Akola stayed with Sharad Pawar after his nephew Ajit Pawar walked out of the NCP last year and joined the Mahayuti government.\n\n""Additionally, the Congress\' assurances including Rs 1 lakh annual financial assistance for women, apprenticeship for youths and raising the quota ceiling are evoking a good response from the people,"" he said. Hussain also said the Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) will more or less retain its vote share but votes of the urban educated may get diverted to Congress. BJP leader from Akola and two-time MLA Randhir Savarkar is counting on the infrastructure works initiated by sitting MP Sanjay Dhotre including the construction of roads, irrigation facilities and Central welfare schemes. ""The voting pattern won\'t change much and the BJP candidate will win by a margin of 3 lakh votes. The overall voting percentage and the BJP\'s vote share will also increase by 5 per cent,"" he said. Senior journalist and political observer Shaukat Ali Mirsaheb is of the view that the main contest lies between Anup Dhotre and Abhay Patil.\n\n""Anup Dhotre has inherited a strong BJP network as his father is a party veteran. The Dhotre senior enjoys a strong network in Akola district also,"" he said. He said the Congress candidate is a strong contender who is active in the social field and enjoys a good connection with all sections of the society including the Maratha community. ""Anup Dhotre is politically inexperienced which may also favour Congress,"" he added. According to Mirsaheb, the ""Modi factor"" won\'t work in Akola this time. ""Voters are worried over inflation, unemployment, MSP, and agriculture distress. There are complaints about people being left out of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and about the PM Awas Yojana,"" he claimed. Speaking about the poll prospects of Prakash Ambedkar, Mirsaheb said the Dalit leader has been contesting from Akola constituency for the last 25 years. ""But there is a question mark on whether Muslim votes will be transferred to Ambedkar,"" he said. Ambedkar was defeated by Sanjay Dhotre in the 2009, 2014, and 2019 elections. In 2009, Ambedkar lost by a margin of 64,848 votes and in 2019 by 2,17,696 votes. In 2019, Dhotre bagged 5,54,444 votes while Ambedkar finished second by scoring 2,78,748 votes. Maharashtra Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Of 48 Constituencies in State, Pune Tops With 8,382 Polling Stations, Sindhudurg Has Lowest at 918.\n\nVBA chief spokesperson and vice president Siddharth Mokle said Ambedkar will get the popular mandate this time as he has been raising his voice against the ""anti-people"" policies of the government. ""People have decided to send Ambedkar to Lok Sabha. They will not vote for candidates of BJP and Congress. Ambedkar has been consistently raising his voice against the policies of the government which are against various sections like farmers, OBCs, Marathas and Muslims,"" he said. Akola Lok Sabha constituency comprises six assembly segments, including three by BJP, and one each by Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress. The Akola West constituency, which was won by the BJP, is currently lying vacant after the death of sitting MLA Govardhan Sharma. Out of 18.90 lakh voters in the Akola LS constituency, Maratha-Kunbi constitutes around 28 per cent, minorities including Muslims 20 per cent, tribals 8 per cent, while Mali, Dhangar and others constitute 20 per cent.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""The country comprises 15 per cent Dalit population, 8 per cent tribals, 50 per cent OBCs, plus the minorities, which make up nearly 90 per cent of the people in the country. But they have almost no representation anywhere and are mostly reduced to doing physical labour or menial jobs,"" Rahul Gandhi said.\n\n""When our government comes to power, we shall scrap this \'artificial ceiling\' of 50 per cent quotas to enable even Marathas and Dhangars get justice and throw jobs in the government open for the people from the deprived sections, the poor and the deserving,"" said Rahul Gandhi. Citing several studies done by the Congress, Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government is working only for the top affluent classes in the country and has ignored the remaining 90 per cent of the population.\n\nHe pointed out that just 22 people hold the wealth equivalent to 70 crore Indians, only one per cent of the population holds 40 per cent of India\'s wealth and resources, and the BJP government only works for the rich people. ""After coming to power, we shall conduct a Caste Census, an economic survey of each section of society, we shall ascertain their representation in government, corporates, higher education, private medical sector, media, etc to give them their due. It would be a revolutionary measure and everything will come out in the open. This shall awaken the country and a new era of politics will begin,"" Rahul Gandhi said.

The Congress leader recalled how, during his Bharat Jodo Yatra and Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, many youth met and lamented that they were rendered jobless by the BJP regime, but when they asked the PM for jobs, he told them to \'sell pakoras\'.\n\n""We are making a list of all the families pushed into poverty during the BJP rule... we shall select one woman from each of these families and provide her with Rs 1 lakh per annum, directly into her bank accounts. This will help the entire family as she looks after all at home,"" he added.

Barring 1996 and 1999, when Prakash Ambedkar was elected as MP from Akola, the BJP has retained its stronghold on the constituency, located in west Vidarbha.\n\nFive constituencies in the Vidarbha region, including Akola, will go on polls on April 26.\n\nThe BJP has fielded Anup Dhotre, son of sitting MP Sanjay Dhotre who won the seat in 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019.\n\nPolitical observers believe that factors like changed caste dynamics with the entry of Dr Abhay Patil, a Maratha, and reorganised political alliances in Maharashtra may dent the BJP\'s prospects this time.\n\nHowever, a BJP leader claimed the party will not only emerge victorious again but will also increase its vote share as he highlighted welfare schemes of the Central government and various works done by sitting MP Sanjay Dhotre.\n\nReferring to the splits in Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray and NCP led by Sharad Pawar, senior Congress leader and former minister Azhar Hussain said there is a wave in favour of MVA in Vidarbha.\n\n""The Congress has fielded a good candidate (Dr Abhay Patil) with a clean image and good public connect,"" he said.\n\nHussain claimed ""Hindutva"" votes will shift to Congress as Shiv Sena (UBT) is working in alliance with the Grand Old Party and the Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar).\n\nHe said NCP workers from Akola stayed with Sharad Pawar after his nephew Ajit Pawar walked out of the NCP last year and joined the Mahayuti government.\n\n""Additionally, the Congress\' assurances including Rs 1 lakh annual financial assistance for women, apprenticeship for youths and raising the quota ceiling are evoking a good response from the people,"" he said.\n\nHussain also said the Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) will more or less retain its vote share but votes of the urban educated may get diverted to Congress.\n\nBJP leader from Akola and two-time MLA Randhir Savarkar is counting on the infrastructure works initiated by sitting MP Sanjay Dhotre including the construction of roads, irrigation facilities and Central welfare schemes.\n\n""The voting pattern won\'t change much and the BJP candidate will win by a margin of 3 lakh votes.\n\nThe overall voting percentage and the BJP\'s vote share will also increase by 5 per cent,"" he said.\n\nSenior journalist and political observer Shaukat Ali Mirsaheb is of the view that the main contest lies between Anup Dhotre and Abhay Patil.\n\n""Anup Dhotre has inherited a strong BJP network as his father is a party veteran. The Dhotre senior enjoys a strong network in Akola district also,"" he said.\n\nHe said the Congress candidate is a strong contender who is active in the social field and enjoys a good connection with all sections of the society including the Maratha community.\n\n""Anup Dhotre is politically inexperienced which may also favour Congress,"" he added.\n\nAccording to Mirsaheb, the ""Modi factor"" won\'t work in Akola this time.\n\n""Voters are worried over inflation, unemployment, MSP, and agriculture distress. There are complaints about people being left out of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and about the PM Awas Yojana,"" he claimed.\n\nSpeaking about the poll prospects of Prakash Ambedkar, Mirsaheb said the Dalit leader has been contesting from Akola constituency for the last 25 years.\n\n""But there is a question mark on whether Muslim votes will be transferred to Ambedkar,"" he said.\n\nAmbedkar was defeated by Sanjay Dhotre in the 2009, 2014, and 2019 elections. In 2009, Ambedkar lost by a margin of 64,848 votes and in 2019 by 2,17,696 votes. In 2019, Dhotre bagged 5,54,444 votes while Ambedkar finished second by scoring 2,78,748 votes.\n\nVBA chief spokesperson and vice president Siddharth Mokle said Ambedkar will get the popular mandate this time as he has been raising his voice against the ""anti-people"" policies of the government.\n\n""People have decided to send Ambedkar to Lok Sabha. They will not vote for candidates of BJP and Congress. Ambedkar has been consistently raising his voice against the policies of the government which are against various sections like farmers, OBCs, Marathas and Muslims,"" he said.\n\nAkola Lok Sabha constituency comprises six assembly segments, including three by BJP, and one each by Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress. The Akola West constituency, which was won by the BJP, is currently lying vacant after the death of sitting MLA Govardhan Sharma.\n\nOut of 18.90 lakh voters in the Akola LS constituency, Maratha-Kunbi constitutes around 28 per cent, minorities including Muslims 20 per cent, tribals 8 per cent, while Mali, Dhangar and others constitute 20 per cent.

He warned against any attempts to undermine or dismantle the Constitution, stating that such actions would erase the country\'s identity.\n\nRahul Gandhi launched scathing criticism against a section of the media for its purported neglect of the issues faced by the poor, contrasting it with the extensive coverage given to events such as weddings in affluent households like the Ambanis.\n\nHe pointed out the influence of Adani, who controls much of the media landscape, and highlighted the alleged scam involving Electoral Bonds, worth thousands of crores, which has not received adequate media attention.\n\nGandhi further accused the BJP government of prioritising the interests of a select few, including Adani, at the expense of the majority. He cited the waiver of loans amounting to approximately Rs 16 lakh crore for a privileged few, asserting that this amount could have been utilised to alleviate the burden of farmers\' loans for the next 24 years.\n\nMoreover, Gandhi criticised Prime Minister Modi for purportedly neglecting key issues such as farmers\' welfare, labour rights, and unemployment.

Karnataka crucial for BJP\'s South India strategy with JD(S) alliance aiming for 20 seats.The BJP and its ally in Karnataka, JD(S), have landed in a tough situation with allegations of sexual harassment against JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda\'s grandson Prajwal Revanna who is also the sitting MP from Hassan. There are claims of thousands of sex videos of Revanna doing the rounds. An FIR has been filed against Revanna and his father HD Revanna in connection with the sexual harassment case at the Holenarasipur police station based on a complaint by their former house help. Revanna has reportedly fled to Germany.\n\nThe Congress is trying to make the most out of the situation. Laxmi Hebbalkar, the women and child welfare minister of Karnataka, accused the BJP leadership of shielding Revanna in the sex scandal case for political gain. She urged the BJP leaders to clarify their stance on the scandal and whether they will continue their alliance with JD(S), despite the exposure of such a huge scandal.\n\nHow the BJP and JDS r reacted\n\nDays after the sexual harassment case was filed against Revanna, the party has suspended him today until the SIT investigation is concluded. The state government has formed an SIT to probe the case. HD Kumaraswamy, former chief minister of Karnataka and Janata Dal (Secular) leader, said during the JD(S) Core Committee meeting on Tuesday, ""Prajwal Revanna\'s suspension is till the investigation is completed.""\n\nThe JD(S) leader said that his party and family are not accountable for Revanna\'s actions. ""...We are not going to protect him, we will take severe action but the government\'s responsibility is more,"" Kumaraswamy said, adding that further details will be shared after the JD(S) Core Committee meeting. Kumaraswamy clarified that he is not seeking protection for Revanna and urged the Karnataka government to uncover the truth behind the issue. He stressed that the government must expose the real picture and ground reality, not him.\n\nThe BJP has distanced itself from Revanna amid the controversy. Union minister Pralhad Joshi has commented that Revanna\'s case won\'t cause any setback for NDA candidates in elections. Joshi pressed for punishment for offenders. ""Anyway, Congress is in power in the state. Let them act against offenders as per the law,"" he added.\n\nWhen asked in Guwahati today about the allegations against Prajwal, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, ""It cannot be tolerated."" He also said that since law and order is a state issue why the Congress government in Karnataka did not take any action till now. He said the BJP and JD(S) are in favour of investigation into the case.\n\nWhy JDS matters in Karnataka\n\nKarnataka plays a key role in the BJP\'s strategy to cross the 50-seat mark in South India. Karnataka is the only state in South India where the BJP has gained dominance. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 25 seats out of the total 28, with a vote share of 51.38%. Though the BJP aims to make a clean sweep in Karnataka this time, it does not seem to be on a stronger wicket. It had lost the assembly elections to the Congress last year, though voter preference could reflect differently in state elections and Lok Sabha elections.\n\nIn 2019, when it made a near-clean sweep, the BJP had fought against an alliance of the Congress and the JD(S). This time it chose to ally with the JD(S) which indicates it doesn\'t want to take any chances and needs help from the JD(S) in southern Karnataka where the regional party has influence among voters, especially the vokkaliga community.\n\nDespite the combined efforts of these two parties, which have a strong voter base in the southern part of the state, BJP had managed to make substantial gains in southern Karnataka in 2019. But political dynamics have undergone a significant shift with the BJP forging an alliance with the JD(s) to take on a resurgent Congress, which has been emboldened by its remarkable victory in the 2023 assembly polls. The JD(S)-BJP partnership is relying on a seamless transfer of votes between the parties in south Karnataka to reach their goal of 20 seats.\n\nMany think the BJP\'s alliance with the JD(S) is a step towards capturing the JD(S)\'s own voter base in the Vokkaliga community and eventually turn Karnataka into a two-party state.\n\n(With inputs from TOI)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sources suggest the party aimed to avoid alienating Vokkaliga voters, predominant in phase 1, due to tensions with the Kurubas, represented by CM Siddaramaiah. The Gowda family, including Prajwal, holds significant influence among the Vokkaliga community, a TOI report stated.\n\nFollowing elections in southern Karnataka, where three members of the Gowda family contested, Siddaramaiah\'s government established a Special Investigation Team (SIT). Prajwal, the grandson of former PM HD Deve Gowda, is seeking re-election from Hassan as an NDA candidate, while his father, HD Revanna, serves as a JD(S) MLA for Holenarsipur. Both were named in an FIR filed recently, alleging sexual harassment by a former domestic help and her daughter.\n\nCritics question why government intervention occurred only after voting concluded, allowing Prajwal to depart the country, despite the widespread circulation of video clips on pen drives before April 26.\n\nThe BJP has accused Revanna of having friendly ties with politicians, influencing the government\'s actions. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi stated, ""To cover up its lapse, the state government is blaming the Union government... None of us have opposed Prajwal\'s suspension from the party. Still, Congress is blaming NDA.""\n\nAddressing a rally in Kalaburagi, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi questioned PM Narendra Modi\'s silence on the matter, highlighting the BJP and JD(S)\'s alliance in these elections. In response, Union Home Minister Amit Shah shifted the responsibility to the state government. ""We want to ask why Congress, despite being in office in Karnataka, hasn\'t acted. Priyanka should ask Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM DK Shivakumar,"" Shah remarked in Guwahati.\n\nShivakumar defended the delay, asserting that action cannot be taken solely based on verbal accusations without legitimate complaints from survivors.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

446,446,"b'Congress aims for double-digit Lok Sabha seat count in Karnataka. JDS joins NDA, key players like Pralhad Joshi and Siddaramaiah have crucial roles. The election battle intensifies as various prominent candidates compete for victory.Buoyed by last year\'s Assembly poll win, the Congress is aiming for a double-digit Lok Sabha seat count in Karnataka, which should help undo the damage of 2019, when the BJP won 25 of 28 seats on a Modi wave. It was Congress\' worst electoral performance since Independence. ET\'s KR Balasubramanyam assesses the Congress-NDA race in the southern state\'s two-phase elections:\n\nThe Big Fight:\n\nOne major difference exists between 2019 and today. Back then, the JDS-Congress coalition was in power in the state and had jointly contested the election. The outcome was a shocker: the Congress and JDS won just one seat each. This time round, the JDS has switched sides. It\'s now a part of the NDA. The BJP is contesting 25 and JDS three seats. Even a member of HD Deve Gowda\'s family is contesting on the BJP symbol. In all constituencies, the fight is between the NDA and Congress.\n\nRahul\'s Guarantee:\n\nThe ruling Congress is upbeat. It believes it rode to power in the Assembly polls last year because of the appeal of its five guarantees to voters. It worked for the party in the Telangana Assembly polls, too. The party\'s PayCM campaign against the BJP left heads rolling in the Assembly polls. Despite a series of public rallies and roadshows by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the party lost the only state it held in southern India. With firsthand experience of how the promise of guarantees can tilt the votes, the Congress has stepped up its game. Its workers are placing the report card of guarantees delivered, and educating voters about the new promises while handing them a fresh set of guarantee cards signed by AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi.\n\nBIG GUNS IN FRAY:\n\nUnion minister Pralhad Joshi, former chief ministers HD Kumaraswamy, Basavaraj Bommai and Jagadish Shettar.\n\nWhy this Election Is Crucial for:\n\nSiddaramaiah: It is more crucial now for the chief minister to establish his appeal among the OBCs, minorities and Dalits and win the Mysuru and Chamarajanagar seats in his home turf, as well as pull off a double digit tally state-wide in general. That will cement the 75-year-old leader\'s position in the government and lift his profile among the party\'s national leaders.\n\nDK Shivakumar: Seen as the CM-inwaiting, the president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) must turn in a stellar performance in the Old Mysuru region to establish his clout over the Vokkaliga voters. A good performance in the other regions will be a bonus. The 61-year-old deputy CM is patiently waiting for his turn to succeed Siddaramaiah. And he is carefully crafting his move, not to let the chance slip, like it happened with Mallikarjuna Kharge around.\n\nBY Vijayendra: This LS election will be the first major test of leadership for the 48-year-old president of BJP\'s Karnataka unit, who is also BS Yediyurappa\'s son. A win in a good number of seats and a convincing lead over the Congress will help him emerge as a strong leader. There is no dearth of critics in the party for this first-time MLA and he can ill-afford a setback.\n\nHD Kumaraswamy: The former CM has often said that he joined hands with the BJP to save his party from being destroyed by the Congress. The enmity between Siddaramaiah and Deve Gowda-Kumaraswamy, both former members of the Janata Parivar, is legendary. If the JDS wins the three seats it is contesting and helps the BJP win some Vokkaliga seats, there will be no looking back for the 64-year-old Vokkaliga leader. There is a strong chance of Kumaraswamy making it to the Union cabinet in the event of NDA\'s win.\n\nPOLL POURRI\n\nCongress\' Barbs at BJP: The Congress has criticised the BJP for delayed release of drought relief to farmers in the state, injustice in tax devolution, and for not clearing funding of the state\'s river projects. It has alleged that the NDA will change the Constitution if voted to power again. On the other hand, voting in favour of Congress will lead to more benefits.\n\nBJP\'s Attack On Congress: The BJP holds that Congress has ignored development, failed to give succour to distressed farmers, and blamed the Centre for its own mismanagement of funds. It has alleged that many people are not getting the benefits of the ""guarantees"" the Congress had promised. A vote for Modi, on the other hand, will usher in stability and prosperity.\n\nPolling: II Phase (April 26): Udupi Chikmagalur, Hassan, Dakshina Kannada, Chitradurga, Tumakuru Mandya, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Bengaluru Rural, Bengaluru North, Bengaluru Central, Bengaluru South, Chikkaballapur and Kolar Polling: III Phase (May 7): Chikkodi, Belagavi, Bagalkot, Vijayurapa, Kalaburagi, Raichur, Bidar, Koppal, Ballari, Haveri, Dharwad, Uttara Kannada, Davangere and Shivamogga'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BJP and Congress will engage in a direct fight in all 14 seats, since JD(S) -- BJP's ally -- had opted out, an admission of its minimal influence in the region.\n\nCongress has intensified its campaign, with CM Siddaramaiah taking centre stage. He addressed rallies in Bidar, Haveri, and Dharwad on Thursday, while former Congress president Rahul Gandhi held rallies in Vijayapura and Ballari on Friday. Sources say Rahul is slated to make at least two more appearances.\n\nBJP is also leaving no stone unturned. Party president JP Nadda recently held a roadshow in Surapura and Kalaburagi, rallying support for Umesh Jadhav, who defeated Kharge in 2019. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to address rallies in Belgaum, Uttara Kannada, Davanagere, Ballari, and Bagalkot Lok Sabha seats on Sunday.\n\nBJP had won all 14 seats in 2019 and is determined to retain them. But it has a stiff challenge on its hands. It traditionally garners support from Lingayats, Marathas, and a section of Scheduled Castes, but in assembly elections last year, Congress managed to secure substantial support from the Lingayat community.\n\nCongress, given a changed political scenario, now faces a challenge of retaining Lingayat votes, while also appealing to Ahinda groups and minorities, its traditional vote banks. Besides winning back support of Lingayats, BJP must also counter Congress' five guarantees.\n\nBJP's success in 2019 adds to the pressure, but the popularity of PM Modi among Lingayats and youth demographics offers some reassurances.\n\nThese polls are significant for figures such as Mallikarjun Kharge and former CM BS Yediyurappa. Kharge must ensure Congress wins more seats in his stronghold of Kalyana Karnataka to maintain his standing within the party.\n\nVictory for BJP would help Yediyurappa and his son BY Vijayendra, BJP state chief, to consolidate their position.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

486,486,"b'Congress targets 20 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka to consolidate power post-assembly success and combat potential challenges from BJP-JD(S) coalition. Emphasis on North Karnataka polls and support from diverse communities.The Lok Sabha polls in Karnataka have emerged as a litmus test for Congress as the results will not only be a referendum on its governance and guarantee schemes but also potentially influence its political stability.\n\nCongress has set itself a formidable target of clinching at least 20 of the 28 Lok Sabha segments in the state -- a massive leap up from the one seat it won in 2019.This ambitious goal is aimed at reinforcing the party\'s hold in Karnataka, following its success in last year\'s assembly elections. A shortfall could potentially embolden the BJP-JD(S) coalition to challenge the state govt\'s stability.\n\nOf particular significance is the second phase of parliamentary elections, which cover regions dominated by the Lingayat community such as Kittur and Kalyana Karnataka, and parts of central Karnataka. Congress has historically fared poorly here and is now under immense pressure to reverse this trend.\n\nTest of welfare schemes\n\nLok Sabha elections are a andate for the Union govt, but results will hold a mirror to the performance of our state govt,"" chief minister Siddaramaiah admitted in an interview with TOI. ""We are confident people are satisfied with our welfare initiatives including the five guarantees. There are ongoing attempts by BJP and JD(S) to bring down our govt, but we expect to emerge stronger.""\n\nIn last year\'s polls, Congress made strategic efforts to engage with the Lingayat community especially after BJP sidelined prominent figures like BS Yediyurappa, Jagadish Shettar and Laxman Savadi. This outreach proved fruitful as the party secured victory in 66 of the 94 assembly segments in the region, garnering an average vote share of 52%.\n\nTremendous response\n\nBasavaraj Rayareddi, chairman, Congress\' campaign for the second phase, expressed confidence in replicating their 2023 performance, citing support from other dominant communities such as OBCs and minorities, in addition to Lingayats.\n\n""The response to our phase-2 campaign has been tremendous,"" Rayareddi said. ""We are confident of winning at least 10 of the 14 seats that went to the polls in phase-1 on April 26 and our performance is expected to be even stronger in North Karnataka in Tuesday\'s polls."" Phase-1 covered segments in South Karnataka which is dominated by the Vokkaliga community and where Congress traditionally fares better.\n\nWith Karnataka one of only two major states where it is in govt, the party is placing significant emphasis on its state unit to enhance its representation at the national level. Having failed twice to secure the necessary numbers to become the principal opposition party in the Lok Sabha, the primary goal is to increase its own seat count while also aiming for a majority for the INDIA bloc.\n\nHOW BJP\'S DOMINANCE GREW\n\nRiding on the positive atmosphere created by the nationwide Ram Mandir movement and the Idgah Maidan controversy in Hubballi, BJP, for the first time, won four seats. Congress registered its lowest-ever tally until then, winning just two seats. The party faced the wrath of Lingayats after Veerendra Patil, a member of the community, was unceremoniously sacked from the chief minister post by Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. Lingayats, who influence election outcomes owing to their population in North Karnataka, threw their weight behind Janata Dal, helping it win seven seats.\n\nIn 1998, strong signs emerged of BJP emerging as an alternative to both Congress and the Janata Dal in North Karnataka. After becoming Prime Minister in 1996 and taking total control of Janata Dal, HD Deve Gowda got his political foe, Ramakrishna Hegde, expelled from the party. This angered Lingayats, who considered Hegde their unquestionable leader. Miffed, Hegde floated the Lok Shakti party and fought the 1998 elections as an ally of BJP. While BJP won six seats, Lok Shakti bagged three. Janata Dal drew a blank.\n\nJanata Dal underwent a vertical split -- JDU and JD(S) -- just a few weeks ahead of the Lok Sabha and assembly elections. Vokkaligas consolidated behind HD Deve Gowda-led JD(S), and Lingayats consolidated behind JDU under the leadership of JH Patel. Hegde dissolved Lok Shakti and teamed up with JDU. BJP and JDU won four and one seat respectively. Their tally fell owing to strong antiincumbency against the Janata Dal govt led by Patel.\n\nBJP\'s electoral fortunes in North Karnataka saw a huge surge as the saffron party won 11 of 14 seats. A huge reason for this is by the time polls were held, JDU had weakened with the deaths of stalwarts JH Patel (2000) and Ramakrishna Hegde (2004), thus ceding space to BJP. Lingayats, who had no political leader from their own community to fall back on, gravitated towards BJP. The saffron party also received a big boost with chief minister S Bangarappa joining the party just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. It helped BJP expand its voter base to backward classes.\n\nWith no third player in the fray to eat into its voter base, especially among Lingayats, BJP\'s supremacy over Congress only grew. The denial of transfer of the chief ministership to BJP by JD(S) -- as agreed on between HD Kumaraswamy and BS Yediyurappa in 2006 when they formed the govt in the state -- further fuelled consolidation of Lingayats behind BJP. This resulted in the party winning the assembly elections in 2008. Some 52 influential political functionaries, including Basavaraj Bommai, CM Udasi, and Prabhakar Kore, quit their respective parties and joined BJP. The emergence of the Reddy brothers and B Sriramulu, a popular ST leader, helped the party strengthen its position in the region.\n\nWith the rise of Narendra Modi as BJP\'s prime ministerial candidate and the wave his name created across the country, BJP continuing its winning streak was not unexpected. It won 11 of 14 seats. Though it dropped one to Congress, its performance in the region was still considered top draw as it came after the party\'s humiliating defeat in the assembly elections just a year previously and the turmoil it witnessed from within in the preceding years. The illegal mining scam saw five BJP ministers, including Yediyurappa and mining baron Janardhan Reddy, being jailed, which only brought disrepute to the party. The party also split, with Yediyurappa floating his own and ensuring BJP\'s defeat in the assembly elections.\n\nRiding high on PM Modi\'s popularity and strong sentiments of nationalism following the Pulwama attack and the subsequent surgical strike, BJP swept the region, winning all 14 seats. The election saw even current AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge suffering his first-ever defeat in his four-decade political career. The anger among people, especially Lingayats, against Congress and JD(S) for forming a coalition govt and thus denying Yediyurappa the CM post despite BJP emerging the single-largest party, also played a major role in the rout of both Congress and JD(S). The lack of coordination among both parties also helped BJP\'s cause.\n\nBJP faces a strong wave of anti-incumbency in eight seats and rebels in two\n\nFor years, North Karnataka has been a bastion of BJP, largely due to the unwavering support of the Lingayat community and the powerful nationalistic image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. BJP candidates have enjoyed consistent electoral success across the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the region.\n\nBut Congress, spearheaded by CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar, engineered a remarkable resurgence in last year\'s assembly polls. It transformed political dynamics in the region.\n\nThe implementation of the party\'s election promises, including fulfilment of the five guarantee schemes, has strengthened its position, posing a formidable challenge to BJP\'s entrenched dominance.\n\nDirect fight\n\nBJP\'s pact with JD(S) will matter little since the regional outfit does not hold much sway here. Therefore, the electoral battle is a direct fight between BJP and Congress.\n\nBJP won all 14 seats in the region in 2019, 11 seats in the 2014 elections and 12 in 2009. If it is to continue to dominate, it must secure all 14 seats. This is crucial for BJP both nationally and within the state.\n\nWinning these seats would not only strengthen the party\'s position but it would also help BJP state president BY Vijayendra assert his leadership credentials, particularly in the wake of his father and Lingayat strongman BS Yediyurappa\'s departure from active politics. There is also significant dissent against him.\n\nOf the 14 constituencies up for grabs, eight feature Lingayat candidates, highlighting the community\'s influence. But, BJP faces considerable challenges, particularly in key constituencies like Shimoga, Belgaum, Dharwad, Gulbarga, and Uttara Kannada.\n\nRetaining the Shimoga seat, held by BY Raghavendra, Vijayendra\'s brother, poses a big -- and crucial -- challenge, especially with former deputy chief minister KS Eshwarappa contesting as a rebel. He is aiming to uproot dynastic politics within BJP. In Belgaum, BJP has strategically fielded Jagadish Shettar, a former CM, hoping to regain support from Lingayat voters who had looked the other way in last year\'s assembly elections.\n\nAnger & dissent\n\nIn Dharwad, Lingayats are incensed with Union minister Pralhad Joshi, posing a threat to his incumbency. Similarly, in Uttara Kannada, the replacement of Anantkumar Hegde with Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri has stirred controversy, with Hegde\'s decision not to campaign for Kageri further complicating matters.\n\nDespite Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s efforts to galvanise support, particularly by dwelling on issues like the Neha Hiremath murder and promoting anti-Muslim narratives, BJP confronts strong anti-incumbency sentiments in eight of the 14 seats. Rebel candidates pose challenges in two seats, further complicating BJP\'s electoral prospects.\n\nThe fate of senior BJP candidates such as Ramesh Jigajinagi, PC Gaddigoudar, Raja Amareshwara Naik, and Gayathri Siddeshwar hangs in the balance. Should they lose, they could well be put out to pasture.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've upgraded more than 700 govt schools in my constituency.\n\nThere are reports that you leveraged Lingayat leaders within the BJP to get Dingaleshwar Swami to withdraw from the race ...\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 No comments on that.\n\nSwamiji had charged that you marginalised and disrespected Lingayat leaders. Former CM Jagadish Shettar, too, had made similar allegations.\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 I haven't marginalised or disrespected any Lingayat leader. I prioritise unity across communities. In my constituency, all four MLAs are from Lingayat community, demonstrating our inclusivity. Both district presidents are also Lingayats. I value the blessings of all communities, including Lingayats, who have consistently supported me. Shettar hasn't made any such allegation. It's not true.\n\nWill the murder of Neha Hiremath have an impact on electoral outcomes in North Karnataka?\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 We, the BJP, prioritise humanitarian values over electoral gains. In the case of Neha's murder, despite her father's political affiliation (Congress), I sought justice. I urged chief minister Siddaramaiah to establish a fast-track court and transfer the case to CBI, respecting the family's wishes. While the state govt treated it lightly, we insisted on an independent investigation. Our commitment to victims transcends politics, we stand by them, combating injustice even beyond elections.\n\nDo you think the Congress guarantee schemes will affect the BJP's poll prospects?\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 Guarantee schemes won't sway our poll prospects. Thousands of women attended our poll rallies despite the heatwave, suggesting they were backing us. People prioritise PM Modi for the nation, not guarantees.\n\nIf you're re-elected, what are your plans for Dharwad Lok Sabha seat?\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 I want to focus on industrial growth, develop the complete Hubballi-Ankola rail line, and develop the Tadadi-Belekeri port, which will attract more investors. We've also done a lot to create infrastructure facilities, including introducing a Vande Bharat Express and taking up airport expansion work to increase flight numbers.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the bigwigs are Union ministers Amit Shah (Gandhinagar), Jyotiraditya Scindia (Guna), Mansukh Mandaviya (Porbandar), Parshottam Rupala (Rajkot), Pralhad Joshi (Dharwad) and SP Singh Baghel (Agra).\n\nFormer Madhya Pradesh chief ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan (Vidisha) and Digvijaya Singh (Rajgarh) have also returned to the Lok Sabha electoral fray this time. The fate of former Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai (Haveri) and Badruddin Ajmal (Dhubri) will also be decided on May 7.\n\nPhase 3 of Lok Sabha elections: Watch out for these key contests on May 7\n\nBaramati (Maharashtra): The Maharashtra constituency is bracing for an interesting clash of the Pawars with NCP founder Sharad Pawar\'s daughter Supriya Sule facing her sister-in-law Sunetra Pawar, who is the wife of Ajit Pawar. The constituency - which has been the stronghold of Sharad Pawar\'s family for decades - has become a proxy battleground for the uncle-nephew power tussle ever since Ajit Pawar staged a revolt and switched to the BJP-led NDA. Supriya Sule is eyeing a fourth term from Baramati in 2024. In the previous election, she had defeated BJP\'s Kanchan Rahul Kul by a margin of 1.5 lakh votes. However, her prospects are shadowed by the looming anti-incumbency sentiment and the relentless onslaught from the ruling alliance, particularly the Ajit-led NCP and BJP, who have launched an aggressive campaign targeting her and Sharad Pawar. Notably, both Sharad and Ajit have represented the constituency in Lok Sabha in the past.\n\nGandhinagar (Gujarat): A BJP bastion since 1989, Gandhinagar has sent party veteran LK Advani to the lower house as many as five times. In 2019, Union home minister Amit Shah contested from the seat for the first time and won by a landslide margin of over 5.5 lakh votes. Shah is contesting again and will face a challenge from Congress\'s Sonal Patel.\n\nGuna (Madhya Pradesh): Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia is looking to reclaim his royal family bastion, which he lost to BJP\'s Krishna Pal Yadav in 2019 when he was part of Congress. The BJP has fielded Scindia instead of incumbent MP KP Yadav in the constituency, hoping that the Union minister will be able to retain the seat due to his deep-rooted connection with the constituency. Scindia, who was with the Congress till 2020, represented the Guna constituency from 2002 to 2019. Scindia\'s grandmother Vijaya Raje Scindia and father Madhavrao Scindia, too, represented Guna in the Lok Sabha\n\nMainpuri (Uttar Pradesh): The Yadav family ""bahu"" and incumbent MP Dimple Yadav will face her first litmus test from the SP stronghold, two years after she recorded a landslide victory in the bypolls following the death of Mulayam Singh Yadav. In the 2024 election, Dimple finds herself in a face-off against BJP\'s Jaiveer Singh, who is the tourism minister in the UP government. BSP\'s Shiv Prasad Yadav is also into the fray, further queering the pitch. The emphasis on Yadav identity by BSP candidate might pose a challenge to Dimple, who comes from a Rajput background and married Akhilesh Yadav in November 1999.\n\nRajgarh (Madhya Pradesh): Former MP CM Digvijaya Singh, who won the elections from the constituency way back in 1984 and then in 1991, has returned to his home turf after three decades. Digvijaya is the son of Balbhadra Singh, the Raja of Raghogarh (under the Gwalior State). Interestingly, he said that it would be the ""last election of his life"". And to end his electoral career on a winning note, Digvijaya will have to see off a stiff challenge from BJP\'s two-time MP Rodmal Nagar. In 2019, Nagar defeated his Congress rival by a commanding margin of over 4.3 lakh votes and is a formidable opponent. But Congress is banking on Digvijaya\'s deep-rooted connection with Rajgarh to reclaim its erstwhile bastions from BJP.\n\nVidisha (Madhya Pradesh): Like Digvijaya Singh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan - another former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh - is hoping to make a mark in the 2024 Lok Sabha election after returning to his home turf of Vidisha. Last year, Chouhan had to sacrifice the CM post for Mohan Yadav after BJP won the 2023 Madhya Pradesh elections. There was a buzz that he may be given an important national role. In 2024, he is now the BJP candidate from Vidisha, a constituency he has won as many as five times from 1991 to 2004. He will face veteran Congress leader and former Vidisha MP Pratap Bhanu Sharma. The high-profile constituency holds special significance for the BJP, as it was previously represented in the lower house by the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the late former foreign minister Sushma Swaraj.\n\nDharwad (Karnataka): Union minister Pralhad Joshi is hoping to win the constituency for a record fifth time in a direct clash with Congress. The prospects of Joshi, who has been the MP from Dharwad since 2004, improved significantly after popular Lingayat seer Dingaleshwar Swamiji of Shirahatti Bhavaikya Peetha withdrew his candidature just weeks before the polling. Joshi has won all four elections with a comfortable margin against the Congress candidates. In the 2019 polls, he secured victory with a margin of just over 2 lakh votes against Vinay Kulkarni of Congress. In 2024, Joshi is facing a challenge from Congress\'s Vinod Asooti.\n\nShivamogga (Karnataka): The contest between the children of two former chief ministers and the presence of an expelled BJP leader in the fray has spiced up the poll scene in Karnataka\'s Shimoga Lok Sabha constituency. The BJP has renominated MP and Yediyurappa\'s son B Y Raghavendra. The Congress has named Bangarappa\'s daughter Geetha Shivarajkumar, who is the wife of Karnataka film star Shivarajkumar and daughter-in-law of Kannada thespian late Rajkumar. While the stage was almost set for a direct clash between Raghavendra and Geetha Shivrajkumar, BJP veteran K S Eshwarappa rebelled against the party over the denial of ticket to his son K E Kantesh from neighbouring Haveri. The former deputy CM has entered the fray as an independent, making it a keen triangular clash.\n\nDhubri (Assam): AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal is locked in a triangular contest to retain the seat for the fourth consecutive term. However, Ajmal, who has dominated the minority-dominated constituency for years, may face tough competition from Congress nominee and former minister Rakibul Hussain and NDA nominee Zabed Islam of the Asom Gana Parishad. Both contenders allege that the AIUDF supremo has failed to deliver on all fronts and is banking on the anti-incumbency factor to wrest the seat. Issues like floods, erosion, poverty and child marriage have dominated the poll narrative in the run up to the elections.\n\nNorth Goa (Goa): Union minister Shripad Naik has been representing the North Goa constituency since 1999 (formerly Panaji constituency) and is looking to clinch a record sixth term. In 2019, he defeated Congress\'s Girish Chodankar by a margin of over 80,000 votes. This time, Congress has nominated veteran politician and former Union law minister Ramakant Khalap from the constituency. Khalap, 76, has a rich political history, having served as an MP on the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) ticket from 1996-1998 and as Union MoS for Law in Rajiv Gandhi\'s cabinet before joining Congress.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

505,505,"b'On April 18, Hiremath\'s daughter Neha, 23, a first-year student of MCA (Masters in Computer Application), was stabbed to death on her college campus, allegedly by her former classmate Fayaz Khondunaik, 23, who was arrested soon after the incident.\n\nThe horror of the killing, caught on CCTV cameras, has left the town shocked while sparking a political firestorm with barely two weeks to go for voting on May 7 in Dharwad constituency of which Hubballi is a part.\n\nSince the murder, a steady stream of politicians have been visiting the family -- from BJP national president J P Nadda and party leaders, such as their Dharwad candidate and Union minister Pralhad Joshi and state chief B Y Vijayendra, to Congress leaders H K Patil (state Law Minister) and AICC general secretary Randeep Surjewala. While the BJP leaders were quick to call the killing a case of ""love jihad"", a line the Hiremath family has since stuck to, the Congress government, while ordering a CID probe, has said the murder was over ""personal matters"".\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, too, referred to the case during his recent rally in Bengaluru, saying ""our daughters are being attacked"" and asking voters to be alert to the ""dangerous... thoughts and ideology being promoted by the Congress government"".\n\nAt the Hiremath household in Hubballi, Annapurna Jakkenkatti, who identified herself as a social worker and a former neighbour, told The Indian Express, ""It\'s all a conspiracy. Those people couldn\'t tolerate that the Lingayats were all together, that this was a happy family.""\n\nNeha\'s father has publicly expressed his unhappiness over the pace of the probe ordered by his party\'s government in the state. On April 23, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah spoke over phone to Hiremath, following which the corporator apologised publicly to the government and police for criticising them.\n\nThe anger and despair at Neha\'s home, however, have not faded. ""We were like friends,"" says Neha\'s mother Geetha, talking of her first-born. ""She was bold, smart, and so beautiful. She would drive me around Hubballi in our car -- there aren\'t too many girls who drive in this city. Since she has left us, people have been coming round the clock. I haven\'t even had time to spend time with her memories,"" she says, wiping an endless stream of tears.\n\nOn April 28, Neha\'s mother was outside the campus, waiting to pick her up after one of her internal exams when she was killed.\n\nHiremath talks of a ""larger conspiracy"". ""The seeds of this conspiracy came from outside and were planted here, solely with the target of religious conversion,"" he says.\n\nAccording to the Hiremath family, Neha and the accused were ""friends"" only briefly and she rejected his proposal to marry him.\n\nSince the murder, a number of photographs and videos have emerged on social media of Neha and Fayaz together. Neha\'s mother Geetha has lodged a cyber complaint alleging that fake social media accounts were created to show the two were in a relationship.\n\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, Fayaz\'s elder sister Nisha, an ayurveda doctor in Munuvalli in neighbouring Belagavi district, says, ""It was in 2021-2022, while they were in their second-year of BCA, that Fayaz told me that Neha and he were in love. I told him to focus on his studies and that Amma is unlikely to agree.""\n\nShe says the family hasn\'t met Fayaz since the incident. ""We are too traumatised. What do I tell him?""\n\nA town in turmoil\n\nThe murder is the talk of the town in an area with a history of communal polarisation and where memories of the riots of 1994 -- when six people were killed in police firing following communal clashes when BJP leader Uma Bharti attempted to hoist the Tricolour at the Idgah grounds -- are still fresh.\n\n""What happened to the family is sad. The Hiremaths are a priestly class among us Lingayats. This incident will surely have an impact on the election. Hindus should come together or India will no longer be a Hindu rashtra,"" says Sidappa Biradar from neighbouring Belagavi district. An assistant manager with MRF Tyres, he is visiting Hubballi on work.\n\nYet, this time, there are many, both among the Lingayat population to which the Hiremaths belong, and the Muslims, who make up around 27 per cent of the population in Hubballi-Dharwad, who see this as a love story gone wrong.\n\nAt his home in Hubballi, A M Hindasgeri, veteran Congress leader and president of the Anjuman-e-Islami in Hubballi, says that as soon as they heard about the incident, he and other Muslim leaders went in a delegation to the police commissioner and asked for a fast-track court to be constituted. ""The next day, 125 mutawallis and 30 ulemas went in a delegation to meet the girl\'s father and consoled him. Girls from our institution carried out a dharna, Muslim shops were closed. We decided we won\'t let hate win,"" he says.\n\nSitting behind the counter at Basaveshwara Khanavali, a popular restaurant that serves the north Karnataka specialty of jowar rotis, Ravi Ganacharya, who identified himself as a relative of the Hiremaths, says, ""Unfortunately, there will be politics played over this and it will be Advantage BJP. They don\'t need this issue this election, but they are playing long-term, with the next Assembly elections in mind.

506,506,"b'The sex scandal allegedly involving Prajwal, who left for Germany early on April 27, provided ammunition to the Congress, which rules the state, to counter the BJP national leadership\'s attacks on issues like ""minority appeasement"" and the murder of a Lingayat college girl Neha Hiremath in Hubballi allegedly by her estranged Muslim friend.\n\nTop Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called Prajwal a ""mass rapist"" during a rally in Raichur on May 2, accusing the BJP leadership of being allegedly aware of the JD(S) MP\'s alleged sex crimes when he was given a poll ticket by its NDA ally.\n\nThe sex scandal itself is however believed to have no bearing, on the ground, on the poll outcome in the three regions bound for Tuesday voting - the Lingayat-dominated Bombay Karnataka (five seats), the impoverished Hyderabad-Karnataka region (five seats), the agricultural central districts (three seats), and one coastal district, Uttara Kannada, which is known for being a Hindutva bastion.\n\nAcross these regions there seems to be an atmosphere of ""strong anti-incumbency"" against the 14 sitting BJP MPs, who are said to be entirely dependent on the Modi factor to sail through, but face challenges even in the pro-BJP Lingayat region of Bombay Karnataka as well as Uttara Kannada.\n\nIn Bombay Karnataka, the Modi factor coupled with the Lingayat community\'s traditional support for the BJP is likely to deliver most of the five seats to the BJP with the Congress appearing to have an edge mainly in the Chikkodi seat.\n\nIn the Hyderabad Karnataka region, where livelihood concerns seem to have trumped nationalistic and religious identity issues, the Congress is seen to have an upper hand in at least three of the five seats due to its ""pro-poor policies"".\n\nThe Gulbarga seat in Hyderabad Karnataka, where the prestige of Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge is at stake, is set to witness a tough fight as local issues involving caste pride have now gained precedence over the Kharge factor.\n\nThe three central Karnataka seats of Davangere, Haveri and Shivamogga will see close contests although the BJP is considered to have an edge in former chief minister B S Yediyurappa\'s Shivamogga turf since the polls featuring Yediyurappa\'s elder son B Y Raghavendra involves the prestige of the Lingayat strongman and his younger son B Y Vijayendra, the state BJP chief.\n\nIn Davangere and Shivamogga, the presence of rebel OBC candidates from the BJP - who may split the votes of the Kuruba community which is allied to Congress CM Siddaramaiah - would make the contests keener.\n\nBJP rebel K S Eshwarappa has thrown his hat in the ring in Shivamogga.\n\nThe BJP\'s former CM Basavaraj Bommai is contesting the Haveri seat while another ex-CM Jagadish Shettar is testing the ground in Belagavi as the BJP nominee following a brief stint with the Congress during which he lost on its ticket from the Hubballi Central Assembly seat in the 2023 polls.\n\nAbout half a dozen relatives of the Congress ministers and leaders - including Kharge\'s son-in-law Radhakrishna Doddamani - are in the fray on the Congress tickets, with the party depending on the implementation of its 2023 poll guarantees to deliver the electoral dividends.\n\n""In both phases of the polls the guarantees have had an impact on the people. This is because all the guarantees have been implemented within eight months of our government coming to power. People have a sense of belief and confidence in the guarantees,"" Siddaramaiah said.\n\n""We will win all five seats in the Kalyana Karnataka region (Hyderabad Karnataka),"" state Congress chief D K Shivakumar said.\n\nIn 2019, the Congress had won just one of the state\'s 28 seats as against the BJP\'s 25. The party is however claiming that it would win most of the seats this time.\n\nKarnataka has a tradition of the party in power bagging a majority of the seats, barring 1983 and 1998 as well as 2014 and 2019 amid the Modi wave.\n\nCurrently, several BJP veterans are in contention in the second phase, including Anna Saheb Jolle from Chikodi, P C Gaddigoudar from Bagalkot and Ramesh Jigjinagi from Bijapur.\n\nIn Hubballi-Dharwad, four-time BJP MP and Union minister Pralhad Joshi is taking on young Congress leader Vinod Asooti. The BJP\'s campaign over the Neha Hiremath murder case is likely to help Joshi clinch a fifth term despite anti-incumbency.\n\nPM Modi himself campaigned in Karnataka for the second phase only on two days covering five constituencies - Belagavi, Uttara Kannada, Davangere and Ballari on April 28 and Bagalkot on April 29.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
507,507,"b'At 4.30pm on April 18, Neha Hiremath, a first-year Master\'s student of computer application was walking towards the college gates of the BV Bhoomaraddi campus of the KLE Technological University, where her mother was waiting to pick her up. On the way, the young woman was accosted by 23-year-old Fayaz Khondunaik, a former classmate who had dropped out of the course. As CCTV recordings captured images that would shock a state, Khondunaik brandished a knife and stabbed Hiremath six times. He fled, only to be arrested later that day. Hiremath was rushed to the hospital but did not survive.\n\nKarnataka went into uproar with sweeping street protests and candle-light vigils. Hiremath\'s family is influential -- her father Niranjan Hiremath is a Congress corporator of the Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation. Within hours, the killing tipped into politics and religion. Khondunaik was Muslim, Hiremath a Hindu. This sparked talk of ""love jihad"", a term that has no legal or government sanction is often used by Hindu right-wing groups to describe relationships involving Muslim men and Hindu women.\n\nIn the three weeks since, the BJP has spoken of Hiremath\'s shocking murder extensively in its campaign. On April 29, at a rally in neighbouring Belagavi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""What happened with our daughter in a college campus in Hubbali shook the entire nation. They don\'t value the lives of our daughters such as Neha. All they care about is their vote bank... ever since the Congress government came to Karnataka, the law and order has deteriorated significantly."" The death has become one of the sharpest points in the BJP\'s campaign to defend its Lok Sabha citadel.\n\nKarnataka is no stranger to political battle lines being drawn over religion. It\'s a state where the history of Tipu Sultan is still fiercely contested in election campaigns; where girl students wearing the Hijab in educational institutions sparked a turmoil and tumult for almost two years; where even cosmopolitan urban centres such as Mangaluru have a history of moral policing laced with religious conservatism.\n\nYet, the row has put into spotlight phenomenon of splinter communal issues - many of them framed around dubious claims such as ""love jihad"" - being fanned by fringe groups and increasingly entering the political mainstream, and its devastating effect on the local social fabric.\n\nThe Hiremath home in Bidnal is two storeys tall, accessible only through a maze of narrow alleys, all at right angles to each other. To its right and to its left are rows and rows of the same kind of two-storey homes -- flat concrete terraces that overlook endless agricultural fields where the urban squalor ends; some populated by sugarcane stalk, others where sunflowers sway gently in the summer breeze.\n\nSince April 18, the stream of visitors who have navigated the thin alleys of Bidnal has been incessant. BJP chief JP Nadda came on April 21, and Union home minister Amit Shah 10 days later. Congress chief minister Siddaramaiah came on April 25, and state women and child development minister Laxmi Hebbalkar on April 20, two days after the death.\n\nFor the first few days after his daughter\'s killing, an inconsolable father publicly said that he believed that it was a case of ""love jihad"", accusing the state police of botching the investigation, and praising Modi for mentioning his daughter\'s case.\n\nThe Congress scrambled into damage control, and underlined that Khondunaik was arrested, and that investigations were underway. On April 23, after Siddaramaiah spoke to him over the phone and multiple ministerial delegations visited, Hiremath seemed to step back, apologising for his comments against the state government. ""I expressed doubts over the inquiry, but it has turned out that the police have done their job properly. I apologise for my words, which was the result of misinformation,"" he said.\n\nHours before Dharwad voted on Tuesday, Hiremath went a step further, and with minister Laxmi Hebbalkar by his side, sought votes in favour of the Congress.\n\nBut the incident has taken a political life of its own.\n\n""In the Neha Hiremath murder case, we have found direct proof of the love jihad that we have been talking about. Today, all Hindus have become alert. The Congress does too much appeasement of the minority community. It is the scene everywhere wherever the Opposition is in power,"" Lingraj Patil, the BJP in-charge said told HT, adding that this was the single biggest issue in the local campaign.\n\nThe Congress, on its part, accused the BJP of politicising the issue. ""Everything should not be politicised, especially in a case where religion has nothing to do with the crime. A similar instance happened in Mysore where the attacker was not Muslim...this shows that the BJP has no other issues to fight these elections,"" Congress leader Amaan Sait told HT.\n\nIf electoral history is a reliable witness, voters of the twin cities of Hubballi and Dharwad, which lie at the centre of the Dharwad Lok Sabha constituency, need little convincing to vote for the BJP. The party has won this seat since 1996, when it was called Dharwad North. After 2008, the seat was renamed Dharwad and has been held by Union minister Pralhad Joshi.\n\nLocal election watchers point to a seminal few years after 1991, seeped in religious politics, that laid the BJP\'s foundation for dominance. Between 1977 and 1996, it was the Congress that ruled Dharwad. But the early 1990s was a time of tumult in Indian politics, when the Babri Masjid was demolished and a great wave of Mandir politics swept the hinterland. In Dharwad, this took a different form, with a custody battle of sorts for the local Idgah Maidan.\n\nTill then, the open space in the centre of town was used primarily for Muslim gatherings besides sundry uses such as parking and makeshift markets. But for two years between 1992 and 1994, the BJP loudly pushed for opening the maidan to multiple communities, particularly Hindus. On August 15, 1994, a tense state government, then run by the Congress, clamped prohibitory orders, but BJP leader Uma Bharti and her supporters defied the diktat, attempting to forcibly hoist the national flag. A commotion ensued, and the police opened fire. Six died.\n\nIn every Lok Sabha and assembly election since then, the BJP has triumphed. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Joshi won the Dharwad seat by a margin of more than 200,000 votes; while in the assembly polls, the BJP retained both the Hubballi Dharwad West and Hubballi Dharwad Central seats -- two of the three urban seats in the district. Jagadish Shettar, a six time MLA and former BJP chief minister who switched from the BJP to the Congress at the time, lost to a first-timer from the BJP by a bigger margin than he had ever won. He has now quietly returned to the BJP fold.\n\n""The people of this constituency have been voting for the BJP across communities and on issues like Hindutva for decades. This time there is the additional factor of the Ram temple, and now the Neha Hiremath murder,"" said a local resident, who did not want to be named.\n\nOne senior Congress leader admitted that Hiremath\'s murder could cause the party damage, particularly at a time when the state government was seeking to focus on the social guarantees it implemented since 2023, and there was a sense of unease among the BJP\'s oldest vote bank -- the Lingayats. ""After all, Hiremath was a Lingayat,"" he said.\n\nThe summer of 2023 was a chastening time for the Karnataka BJP. It lost its only state government south of the Vindhyas, falling from 104 seats in 2018 to 66 in 2023. There were many post-mortem examinations; blame was laid at the door of the perception that the state government had fallen prey to corruption and that the leadership was uninspiring.\n\nBut for most, the beginning of the fall came in July 2021 when the BJP replaced Lingayat stalwart and then chief minister BS Yediyurappa with Basavraj Bommai, an attempt at a generational change. The move backfired; the Lingayats, who are the largest community in the state, retreated from the BJP. The effects were particularly stark in central and northern Karnataka, especially in districts such as Dharwad where they are close to a quarter of the population. The Congress won four of the seven assembly segments.\n\nIn November, a chastised BJP course-corrected, and BY Vijayendra, Yediyurappa\'s son, became the state unit chief, putting the party\'s first family in the state back in charge. And yet, right until voting day, there is some evidence of continued discomfiture.\n\nOn April 8, Dingaleshwar Swamiji, a popular seer of the Lingayat Shirahatti Fakireshwar Math in Shirahatti outside Hubballi, announced his candidature as an independent against Joshi, accusing him of suppressing the Lingayat community. Two weeks later, on April 23, the seer withdrew.\n\nThe BJP has brushed aside the challenge posed by the Lingayat seer as an underhand attempt by the Congress to split the BJP votes. ""In Hubballi, the Congress has tried to raise issues of caste and to disturb voting patterns on these lines. But it will not work,"" Lingraj Patil said.\n\nThe Congress pick from Dharwad is Vinod Asooti, a Kuruba who is from the same caste as Siddaramaiah, and a first-time contestant. Before this, Asooti unsuccessfully contested the 2018 state assembly elections from the Navalgund seat in north-east Dharwad and is a two-term state district Congress chief. ""The question facing Asooti is how he is going to take on the BJP\'s dominance in the Hubballi Dharwad (West), currently represented by the BJP\'s Arvind Bellad and the Hubballi Dharwad (Central), currently represented by Mahesh Tenginakai, both of which have given a lead of more than 50,000 votes each to Joshi,"" a Congress leader said, requesting anonymity.\n\nA second Congress leader said the AHINDA - a Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes and Dalits - could help the party. ""Surveys have shown that the Congress guarantees are working and have had a huge impact among rural voters and women voters,"" the leader added, requesting anonymity.\n\nBut in the bylanes of Bidnal, the conversation is far away from any mention of candidates; of Asooti or Joshi; even of Modi or Siddaramaiah. The rumours and allegations around the murder have deepened faith-based fault lines, forced the Muslim community, who form a fifth of the population, into silence, and ratcheted up hostility.\n\n""The murder and the speculation around it has shocked the city and left us with a feeling that no one is safe,"" said Shanmukhappa Basavanneppa Tirlapur, a local school teacher.\n\n""I feel the community is being blamed for the actions of one individual. It was not our fault that the murder happened...unfortunately I can see that people will use this as an excuse to divide us,"" a Muslim rickshaw driver, who declined to be named, said.\n\nOutside Neha Hiremath\'s pale yellow home, too, the mood is sombre. In a plain white shirt, his face sombre and drawn, an elderly relative, who refuses to be named, dreads the weeks to come, and the shrill communal pitch the issue has taken. ""With the voting done, the issue will be forgotten, and the family will be left to bear the loss. Even now, look around you. The media has gone,"" he said. ""But our scars -- those of the family and the community -- will remain.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
508,508,"b'On Thursday, a 24-year-old woman, Neha Hiremath (daughter of Niranjan Hiremath), was stabbed to death allegedly by her acquaintance inside the BVB College campus at Hubballi. She was a first-year master of computer applications (MCA) student at the college. The accused, identified as 23-year-old Fayaz (who goes by a single name), went inside the college campus with a knife and wearing a mask and stabbed the woman multiple times in chest and neck around 3.30 pm, police said. He is an MCA dropout and a resident of Savadatti in Belagavi district.\n\nOn Friday, several organisations and student activists staged protests in the city demanding justice from the victim. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) led a protest calling for a college bandh in the metro area. Other groups such as the Hindu Jagran forum, Sri Ram Sena, and Vishwa Hindu Parishad workers staged demonstrations in front of the BVB College, demanding accountability for the crime.\n\nAs the student organisations held rallies demanding justice, the police closed off the entire BVB College Road and installed various security measures.\n\nIn Belgaum, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists blocked roads at Chennamma Circle, demanding stringent action against Fayaz and criticised the state Congress government\'s handling of the incident. Besides, protestors in Raichur sought enhanced security around college campuses and urged for a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the case. In Bengaluru, students gathered to condemn the murder, following which the police detained some as they attempted to block the roads.\n\nMeanwhile, remarks from chief minister Siddaramaiah and state home minister Parameshwara have drawn sharp criticism from the victim\'s family.\n\nOn Friday, Siddaramaiah convened a meeting with DGP Alok Mohan and city police commissioner B Dayanand for over an hour, instructing them to take stringent steps to prevent crimes. He directed severe action against the accused. Following the meeting, he said, ""Neha\'s murder happened due to personal reasons. The law and order situation in the state is good, and it is the duty of the government to maintain it, which we will fulfil.""\n\nSpeaking to media in Tumakur, Parameshwara said, ""Neha\'s murder at the BVB Engineering College premises in the city has nothing to do with politics. Neha and the accused Fayaz were in love with each other. Later, she tried to distance herself from Fayaz."" He further said, ""Fayaz became angry and committed the murder. There is no evidence of love jihad in this case. If such events occur coincidentally, legal action will be taken against the accused.""\n\nHowever, the father of the victim, who is also a Congress leader took objections to the statement from the CM. Expressing concerns over the spread of ""love jihad"", Niranjan said, ""Mothers need to be vigilant regarding their college-going daughters."" He refuted the statements made by the chief minister and home minister and said: ""Your statements are misleading and tarnishing the image of my family. I know who my daughter is. My concern is that no girl should be subjected to this kind of trauma. If the home minister\'s statement is aimed at appeasing the vote bank, it won\'t work out.""\n\nResponding to the incident, Union minister Pralhad Joshi said that it is evident that law and order has deteriorated under the administration of the Congress government.\n\n""Due to the government\'s appeasement policy, there is a lack of fear among sociopaths in the state. The Congress government should treat such incidents seriously. I have spoken to corporator Niranjan Hiremath, the father of the deceased young woman. There must be a thorough investigation into this case. An innocent girl has been murdered. Will the state home minister G Parameshwar answer?"" he questioned.\n\n""The accused of the murder should be hanged; severe punishment should be meted out,"" he said while urging no lawyer to take up the defence of the accused.\n\nThe sentiment, however, was not limited to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Gadag district in-charge minister Santhosh Lad condemned the incident while calling it as ""highly reprehensible"". ""The murder of student Neha Hiremath is highly condemnable; encounter laws (extra-judicial killings by police) should come into force to prevent such heinous acts.\'\'\n\nMuslim community leaders denounced Neha\'s murder and called for swift action against the accused. They urged the police commissioner to take decisive measures. The presidents of Alnavara, Kundagola, Kalaghatagi, Hubli, and Dharwad Anjuman appealed to the commissioner to ensure justice was served by hanging the perpetrator.\n\nMeanwhile, Fayaz\'s hometown remained quiet. All shops in Munavalli town in Savadatti taluk of Belgaum district voluntarily closed to condemn Neha\'s killing and demonstrate solidarity. To ensure safety, three Karnataka state reserve police (KSRP) teams, one district armed reserve squad, and over 100 policemen were deployed. Police also appointed security personnel at the accused\'s residence.\n\nNeha\'s body was cremated at Kalburgi Mutt crematorium in Hubballi, adhering to Veerashaiva rituals.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So rather than getting into the investigation, the CM is trying to protect the culprits.\n\n""The present Congress government does not care about anything. Earlier, when a blast took place in Mangalore, Deputy CM DK Shivakumar said it was a small stray incident and not a terrorist attack. Later when an investigation was carried out, many people were arrested. As far as the Hubballi- Dharwad incident is concerned, it is very unfortunate on the part of the CM. Instead of coming to the rescue of the family, he says the murder took place due to a personal vendetta. Women across the state are questioning the state government,"" he said.\n\nOn Saturday, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said that the murder of Congress corporator\'s daughter Neha Hiremath in Hubballi is not a case of ""love jihad"" as alleged by the BJP.\n\nThe Chief Minister, while speaking to the media here, hit out at the BJP and accused the party of politicising the murder for politics.\n\nCondemning the incident, the CM said, ""This is not a case of love jihad. I condemn the incident. We have arrested the culprit, the investigation is going on seriously and we will punish the culprit. We have taken care of law and order seriously to maintain peace and harmony. BJP is using this issue for politics, it is condemnable that a political party (BJP) is using the murder of a girl for political purposes.""\n\nUnion Minister Pralhad Joshi claimed that the case is of \'love jihad\', but the state government does not want to investigate.

On Monday senior leaders of the BJP asserted the party had no role in selecting the candidate for the seat, given it was allocated to the ally.\n\nAttempting to insulate the party from the controversy that has singed its ally, party leaders in the central team and the state said the blame for Revanna\'s alleged crimes cannot be laid at the BJP\'s doors.\n\n""The BJP is not responsible for the selection of the candidate or for certifying their character if the contestant is from an alliance partner. The alliance is for election purposes, but the decision of candidate selection is not done by the BJP. Once the seat sharing was discussed, the authority to decide the candidate rests with the party that is contesting from the seat,"" said BJP national general secretary Radha Mohan Das Agrawal.\n\nAgrawal, who is overseeing the election in Karnataka also lashed out at the Congress party for targeting the BJP over Revanna. Responding to the charge that the BJP was aware of the allegations against Revanna, and could not persuade the ally to change the contestant from Hassan, he said, ""The Congress party and its leader Rahul Gandhi are trying to politicise the issue, but they need to clarify do they decide the candidates for their alliance partners? They should admit if the candidates for the INDI parties (INDIA bloc) were selected by them.""\n\nThe Congress has accused the BJP of not prevailing on the alliance partner for dropping Revanna, despite being aware of the allegations against him.\n\nState minister Laxmi Hebbalkar said, ""Union home minister Amit Shah, Karnataka BJP chief BY Vijayendra knew about such CDs and videos as BJP leader Devarajegowda wrote a letter to BY Vijayendra and also spoke with him.

However, when the party, through former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa, a prominent Lingayat leader, announced that Joshi would not be replaced, the seer said that he would consider contesting independently or supporting another candidate.\n\n""Due to the unanimous decision of Swamiji\'s and elders of our community, as well as others who have been victimised by Joshi, I have decided to contest against him independently,"" Dingaleshwar Swami said, adding that Joshi had not only neglected Lingayats but also prevented people from his Brahmin community from gaining political prominence.\n\nDingaleshwar said that his candidacy aims to prevent Joshi\'s atrocities against non-Brahmins. ""Joshi was instrumental in removing Yeddyurappa, who was ousted for unknown reasons before completing his term. He also caused trouble for another Lingayat former CM Basavaraj Bommai, who replaced Yeddyurappa in the last term,"" the seer said.\n\n""The political decisions of Lingayats are solely directed against Joshi and not against the BJP,"" he added, pointing out that the Lingayats, who constitute the highest number of voters in the northern region of the state, would teach Joshi and the BJP a lesson for refusing to change his candidacy in Dharwad. ""The BJP\'s decision to disregard the pleas of Lingayats will prove costly in the rest of the constituencies in north Karnataka,"" the seer said.\n\nPointing out the denial of tickets to former CM Jagadish Shettar and former BJP deputy CM, Congress legislator Lakshman Savadi, both from the Lingayat community, in the last assembly election, the seer said, ""Although experienced and senior figures, Shettar and Savadi failed to comprehend Joshi\'s conspiratorial tactics, which sidelined those he considered his competitors. He also orchestrated false allegations resulting in Congress legislator Vinay Kulkarni\'s imprisonment and prevented him from entering the district.""\n\nWhile the seers of two highly influential Lingayat mutts in Belagavi declined to comment on Joshi\'s atrocities against Lingayats, they expressed their support for Dingaleshwar\'s decision to contest. One of the seers, on condition of anonymity, said, ""Most of the mutts in the state engage in social work, providing freshly cooked food round-the-clock to everyone who visits the mutt throughout the year. Such seers must enter the political sector, where they can have more opportunities to reach the needy, helpless, and underserved, as well as protect the tarnished image of the political sector.""\n\nIn response to Dingaleshwar\'s decision, the Union minister said, ""Every eligible person can contest the elections. I regard the Swamiji as one of the candidates against me and will approach the election as I have in previous ones.""\n\nHe further said that his track record in the constituency, ministerial responsibilities to the nation, and the people\'s desire to re-elect Narendra Modi as Prime Minister would aid in retaining his seat.\n\nHaving represented Dharwad for the third consecutive term, Joshi expressed confidence that the Lingayats, who have supported him in all previous elections, would continue to do so.

I have been talking about its intention, and I had named it \'Dharma Yuddha\'. I had said this should be an election of self respect. Amid this, I have withdrawn the nomination that I had filed,"" Dingaleshwar Swami said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters here, he said, leaders of both Congress and BJP were in constant touch with him after he filed the nomination, and former chief ministers from the BJP and the current chief minister, his deputy and district in-charge minister also spoke to him on Sunday night.\n\n""Several devotees and Mathadipatis (pontiffs) have been sharing their opinions, and I have been responding to them. But the reason for me to withdraw my nomination today is because my guru (head of math) gave me an order that it\'s better to withdraw my nomination for now. So, abiding by the guru\'s order, I have withdrawn my nomination. But I will continue my Dharma Yuddha that I had announced,"" he added.\n\nLingayats are said to be the majority among voters in the Dharwad segment, while Joshi, a four-time MP, is a Brahmin. Vinod Asooti is the Congress candidate.\n\nThe seer, in response to a question, said he will continue his ""Dharma Yuddha"" by other means, other than contesting in the election.\n\nAsked if he will be supporting the Congress, he said, ""I have never spoken about supporting any party. I have not shared whether I\'m in favour or opposed to any party. But I have already said as to who is not required in this constituency as part of my Dharma Yuddha. I have also shared the injustices that we have faced, and continue fighting on those issues.""\n\nThere were earlier reports that Congress was weighing options to back the seer.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
517,517,"b'Lingayat seer Dingaleshwar Swamiji announced his decision to contest against union minister Pralhad Joshi. His candidature as an independent will have a partial, if not major, impact on BJP votes in the Dharwad Lok Sabha seat\n\nThere is another storm brewing in the BJP\'s teacup. Prominent Veerashaiva Lingayat seer Fakira Dingaleshwar Swamiji is all set to fight the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from Karnataka\'s Dharwad constituency, and is up against union minister and BJP candidate Pralhad Joshi. At the outset, it looks like just another poll contest, other than the fact that it could marginally hurt the saffron party\'s electoral chances but significantly dent its image in the state.\n\nCalling this election a ""dharma yuddha"", the Lingayat seer, who is head of the Shirahatti Fakkireshwar Math, announced his decision to contest against Joshi. He not only accused the minister of neglecting the Lingayat community, but also insulting them.\n\nDingaleshwar Swamiji is a popular religious leader, who is known as a highly intellectual and extremely articulate leader with a large following. So, his decision to contest the polls comes at a time when the union minister is seeking re-election from the Dharwad seat for the fifth time.\n\nThe seer\'s candidature as an independent will have a partial, if not major, impact on the BJP votes in the seat. ""People feel that elections in the state have become like match-fixing,"" alleged Dingaleshwar Swami, adding that he is contesting to provide justice to every community.\n\n""Five years ago, when the 2019 elections took place, he approached me and sought my blessings. At that time as well, I had asked him if I was an instrument for him only during the elections? He (Joshi) asked me for one final chance and sought my forgiveness, which I did,"" he said, targeting Joshi, who is the minister for parliamentary affairs as well as coal and mines.\n\nTraditionally, Lingayats are known to back the BJP and this politically dominant community comprises nearly 17 to 18 per cent of Karnataka\'s electorate. The community also dominates close to 100 out of the 224 assembly segments in the state.\n\nIn the recently held assembly election in Karnataka, the Lingayats switched sides to give the Congress a thumping victory - 135 out of 224 seats. The Dharwad constituency is also dominated by Lingayats, but Joshi, who is from the Brahmin community, has won here thrice in a row. If you look at the breakup, the Lok Sabha seat has at least 5.5 lakh Lingayats, 3.5 lakh Muslims, 2 lakh Kurubas and 2.7 lakh from the SC community.\n\n""I have announced my decision to contest as an Independent from the Dharwad Lok Sabha seat based on many repeated requests by local leaders who feel cheated by the sitting MP,"" the seer said.\n\nDingaleshwar Swamiji told News18 how he had felt insulted by the leader and, despite repeated requests, Joshi had turned a blind eye to the demands or pleas of the Lingayats. Recalling the insult meted out to him, he said: ""Three years ago, I had approached him for some help on a matter. Let alone help, in turn, he asked me why I did not approach a Lingayat leader. Is this the way to insult the community? Joshi should remember that people from different communities have voted him to power.""\n\nHe further alleged that the four-time MP was elected as a custodian of the people of the region, but has miserably failed to keep up with the promises he made. ""From talukas to state leaders, he has hurt people. Every politician has faced hurt by him, every community in Karnataka has faced some form of hurt or humiliation by him. I have been hearing about such grievances from people and have even told him about it. He would ask my forgiveness and say he would work better the next time. There was never a next time,"" he added.\n\nIn Shimoga, in a tirade against pariwarvaad, senior BJP leader KS Eshwarappa also announced his decision to contest as an Independent. He will be up against his party\'s candidate and son of former chief minister BS Yediyurappa. Dingaleshwar Swamiji said Joshi had played a major role in Eshwarappa\'s son being denied a ticket in the 2023 assembly election, and now the Lok Sabha polls.\n\n""I had warned Eshwarappa and his son not to trust Pralhad Joshi. Told him (Eshwarappa) not to back down when the ticket was denied and that there were many power centres at play to ensure the denial of the ticket. Now you see what happened in reality,"" he said.\n\nDingaleshwar Swamiji further alleged that both the BJP and Congress have neglected the Lingayat community and, so, this has forced Veerashaiva leaders like him to enter the electoral fray to bring about justice for their community.\n\nOn March 27, a group of seers from Dharwad had met under his leadership to urge the BJP to change Joshi\'s candidature for the Dharwad seat. They had set a deadline of March 31, but after there was no move from Delhi, the mutt leader decided to field himself as a candidate.\n\nJoshi preferred not to say anything about the seer\'s comments or the decision to contest against him. ""I have no reaction to Dingaleshwar Swami... whatever he says, I will consider them as blessings for me,"" he said.\n\nIn Karnataka, the outcome of the elections can often hinge on the approval or disapproval of the leaders of religious institutions known as mutts. These are important religious establishments, prevalent across the state and represented by different castes and communities including Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Kurubas, Valmikis, Nayakas, and Madigas.\n\nThe mutts are a spiritual centre, which are also deeply entrenched in providing education and rehabilitation of the underprivileged in society. While some of these places refrain from being directly involved in politics, mutt heads are often known to advise their followers to vote for any party of their choice while others openly advocate support for specific political parties or community leaders. The Lingayats alone have over a thousand mutts in Karnataka.\n\nThe Congress, meanwhile, has fielded a Kuruba leader, Vinod Asuti, from the seat. Karnataka will vote in two phases, and Dharwad will go to polls on May 7.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
518,518,"b'In an exclusive interview with News18, the union minister and BJP leader who is eyeing a fifth straight term from the Dharwad Lok Sabha seat in Karnataka also said that the Prajwal Revanna sex tape controversy will have no impact on the saffron party\'s poll prospects\n\nHas the supposed ""cold war"" between Congress\'s Karnataka heavyweights DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah reached a new stage with one side approaching the Bharatiya Janata Party and seeking the central government\'s help to ""do something against"" the other camp? In an exclusive interview with News18, union minister Pralhad Joshi hinted at this.\n\nWhen asked about the alleged fight over the chief minister\'s chair and where it could head after the Lok Sabha polls, Joshi said, ""Infighting is so much. Siddaramaiah and DKS groups are fighting. Some people want something from the central government against the other group. Siddaramaiah\'s people say he will continue, DK Shivakumar says he will become CM. Daal mein kuch kaala hai (something is fishy),"" he said.\n\nThe minister is eyeing a fifth straight term from the Dharwad Lok Sabha seat in Karnataka and says that his work over the last 20 years will ensure a record election win for him. The date for voting in Dharwad is May 7, which is the third phase of the ongoing general elections.\n\n""UPA used to approve projects and give very small amounts. But under PM Modi we have got everything. We have expanded the airport and are adding a new terminal now. New bypasses are constructed. We have 24\xc3\x977 water for Hubballi-Dharwad and the entire district. We have started Vande Bharat, we can reach Bengaluru in 5.5 hours. We want to take people from Dharwad to Bengaluru in 4 hours. The Hubballi-Ankola railway line will be cleared very shortly. We want to see Hubballi developed in a systematic manner,"" he said.\n\nThe ruling Congress has accused Pralhad Joshi and the BJP of politicising the Neha Hiremath murder case. The young college student was brutally stabbed to death inside her college in Hubballi. The BJP has held several protests over the issue ever since. ""We did not say anything initially. The chief minister\'s reaction was casual and erratic. The father spoke with anger. People said this government may hush up the case and start agitation. We have no role. The entire Dharwad got up and said we won\'t tolerate this; it was a spontaneous thing. The father said my daughter was asked to convert. She said she wouldn\'t, that\'s why she was killed. It was a crisis; we have responded. We don\'t need this type of incident to win. We don\'t do politics on dead bodies,"" argued Pralhad Joshi\n\nThe BJP MP also lashed out at the Congress government in Karnataka, accusing it of moving all Muslim subsects into the reservation matrix. He said the move was part of the Siddaramaiah government\'s appeasement politics. ""I have got the NCBC notice copy. The state government has said the entire Muslim community needs to be added to the OBC. Only some communities were in category A. They have said it\'s neither a caste nor religion. Muslims claim they are a Dharma. Why should all Muslims be given reservation? Even in the Rameshwaram Cafe blast case, they called it a cylinder blast. They don\'t want to say Islamic fundamentalists have done it. They want to support or protect Muslims in such cases,"" Joshi said.\n\nThe Prajwal Revanna sex tape controversy has hit national headlines and many from the Bharatiya Janata Party are worried about any possible impact of it among women voters. Joshi though argued that the row over the now-suspended JD(S) leader will not affect the BJP in any manner. ""The Prajwal Revanna video case and the BJP have no connection. They are our partners now. Let there be an investigation. Let them have their investigation. I don\'t think it will have an impact on the BJP\'s prospects in Karnataka,"" said Joshi.\n\nCheck Lok Sabha Election 2024 Phase 3 Schedule, Key Candidates And Constituencies At News18 Website.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
519,519,"b'In mid-March, a senior Congress leader in Karnataka confessed to this correspondent that the party would be happy even if it won 7 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in the State since this would be a significant improvement over the one seat it won in 2019. Things have changed substantially since then for the Congress, with party insiders now confidently estimating that they will win 12-14 seats, if not more.\n\nThis surge of optimism is matched by the findings of the latest survey conducted by Eedina.com, a Kannada news portal that accurately predicted the number of seats the Congress would win in the 2023 Assembly election. According to the survey, conducted in mid-April, the Congress could win 13 to 18 seats, with the BJP-Janata Dal (Secular) alliance winning the rest. Karnataka votes in two phases, on April 26 and May 7, with 14 seats in each phase.\n\nAll through April, the Congress set the electoral narrative through a barrage of messaging, focussing on two key issues: its successful implementation of the five guarantees that were proclaimed in the run-up to the Assembly election, and the injustice in the devolution of funds from the Union government. While the impact of the guarantees (especially the free bus travel for women) is tangible, the Congress has also broken down the intricacies of the fiscal-federal relationship to emphasise that taxes collected in Karnataka are not used for development works for the State but diverted to other parts of the country.\n\nAccording to Muzaffar Assadi, former Dean, Faculty of Arts at the University of Mysore, this focus on State issues will help the Congress as ""there is a paradigm shift in the voters of Karnataka who used to vote on national issues but are thinking more about State issues now"".\n\nThis message has struck its intended target, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and other BJP leaders have been forced to respond. At a rally in Chikkaballapur on April 20 that Modi and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda of the JD(S) attended, Deve Gowda even waved a copy of The Hindu displaying an advertisement of the Congress that claimed that Karnataka received only Rs.13 for every Rs.100 that its taxpayers contributed to the Union exchequer. The nonagenarian followed this up with a strong rebuttal highlighting the Modi government\'s largesse to Karnataka.\n\nAlso Read | South Karnataka: April 26 to see tough fight for 14 seats\n\nWith no major charge of corruption in its almost year-long reign and subdued public dissension between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy, D.K. Shivakumar, the Congress has also not given the BJP any opportunity to build a campaign against the party. The drought across Karnataka, the worst in four decades, could have provided the BJP with ammunition to target the Congress, but even this failed to take off as the State government approached the Supreme Court with a writ petition accusing the Union government of denying financial assistance for drought management in the State.\n\nThe BJP alleged that crimes have been on the rise since the Congress came to power and the State\'s economy was heading towards bankruptcy because of the unsustainable expenditure on the five guarantees. But, again, the accusations are not substantively backed by data.\n\nThe BJP, which ran an aggressive campaign during the Assembly election focussing on communal issues, has attempted to sporadically highlight issues such as the bombing at Rameshwaram Caf\xc3\xa9, allegations of slogans favouring Pakistan in the Vidhana Soudha, and so on. But none of these cases, premised on the rhetoric of ""Muslim appeasement"", has translated into a sustained campaign that could have built up a groundswell of support for the party.\n\nBJP MPs such as Pratap Simha, Nalin Kumar Kateel, and Ananth Kumar Hegde, known as aggressive votaries of Hindutva, have not been renominated. Former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who was unceremoniously removed from his position in 2021, was brought back into prominence when his son, B.Y. Vijayendra, was made State president, and his candidate, R. Ashoka, the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. All these developments point to the party having backed off from underlining a surcharged communal message to voters.\n\nThe BJP roadshow in Bengaluru on April 23. | Photo Credit: IDREES MOHAMMED\n\nY.G. Jagadeesh, a senior political affairs journalist with the Kannada newspaper Prajavani, agreed with this assessment: ""If you examine the basis on which BJP candidates have been chosen, more than their endorsement of Hindutva, it is the individual\'s political family, caste, and personality that are responsible for their selection.""\n\nIn this scenario, the BJP is banking on the charisma of Modi, who has visited the State thrice, to sway the electorate. BJP leaders are reaching out to the electorate with the mantra of development and the success of Central government schemes such as free ration and the Ujwala Yojana (provision of free LPG).\n\nEven though the BJP has not foregrounded communal issues in its campaign so far, the murder of a Lingayat girl called Neha Hiremath by a jilted youth called Fayaz Khandunayak on April 18 in Hubballi gave the party an opportunity to swoop down on the case as an instance of ""love jehad"".\n\nAlso Read | \'Electoral democracy is not an even playing field in India today\': Krishna Byre Gowda\n\nModi\'s strident campaign in Rajasthan on April 21, where he falsely accused the Congress of stating in its manifesto that it would divert resources to Muslims, worked like a dog whistle for his followers in Karnataka as well. The BJP leadership in the State organised protests across Karnataka on April 22, possibly in an attempt to polarise the electorate on communal lines or even get the party\'s loyal Lingayat voters across north and central Karnataka to reiterate their faith in the BJP. Modi made a similar last-ditch attempt during his campaign for the Assembly election as well, when he appealed to voters to raise the slogan ""Jai Bajrangbali"" (Hail Lord Hanuman) before casting their vote but this did not rouse the electorate then, which brought back the Congress.\n\nThe BJP is also placing faith in its cadre\'s ability to convince fence-sitters. With its 25 MPs facing allegations of not having represented Karnataka\'s interests adequately in the Lok Sabha, several incumbents have been replaced. With the BJP\'s emphasis on ""Modi ki Guarantee"" pitched against the Congress\' five guarantees, Karnataka is set to see a battle of ""guarantees"".\n\nIn terms of diversity, the majority of the candidates -- both from the Congress and the BJP-JD(S) alliance -- are Lingayats and Vokkaligas, the two dominant castes of Karnataka. While the Congress has no Brahmin candidates and has also given a ticket to a Muslim, the BJP-JD(S) alliance has three Brahmins and fewer backward-class candidates, reflecting the respective social bases of both the formations. Political dynasts have been privileged by all the three parties, with the most egregious example coming from Deve Gowda\'s family: His son (H.D. Kumaraswamy), grandson (Prajwal Revanna), and son-in-law (Dr C.N. Manjunath) are contesting the election. In the Congress, a staggering 16 candidates are political dynasts while the number from the BJP is 8. (A point that needs to be made here is that this tally includes political debutants as well as experienced politicians).\n\nSome of the high-profile contests that the State will see include the battle for Bengaluru Rural where Shivakumar\'s brother and three-time parliamentarian, D.K. Suresh, is contesting against Dr Manjunath. The battle, apart from testing the impact of the BJP-JD(S) alliance, is also a direct fight between the families of Shivakumar and Deve Gowda for the Vokkaliga vote in south interior Karnataka.\n\nThe voting trend here will spill over in eight constituencies where the JD(S) has a presence, although the party is competing in only three seats. In Dakshina Kannada, famed as the laboratory of Hindutva and a constituency that the BJP has won continuously since 1991, the Congress is mounting a spirited campaign. The Congress candidate, Padmaraj R. Poojary, a Billava and a newcomer, is pitted against Captain Brijesh Chowta, a Bunt and a former soldier who is also contesting his first election.\n\nAlso Read | In a blow to BJP, Lingayat seer enters political fray in Dharwad Lok Sabha seat\n\nShivamogga will test the loyal BJP voter, as one of the senior-most leaders of the party, K.S.

Raghavendra, Yediyurappa\'s son, and Geetha Shivarajkumar from the Congress, the daughter of former Chief Minister S. Bangarappa.\n\nIn Mysore-Kodagu, the BJP replaced its incumbent candidate with the scion of the Mysore princely state, Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wodeyar, who is banking on his forefathers\' legacy. Siddaramaiah is personally investing efforts in this constituency where the Congress\' candidate, M. Lakshman, presents himself as the ""common man"".\n\nIn Dharwad, the key question for the BJP is whether the Lingayats will continue to support the party given that a prominent Lingayat pontiff, Fakir Dingaleshwar, has been spearheading a campaign against Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, the BJP\'s Brahmin candidate.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
520,520,"b""The BJP and the Congress are locked in a direct fight for the 14 Lok Sabha seats of north Karnataka that will vote on May 7. In 2019, the BJP swept this region, winning all the 14 constituencies, with the Congress suffering a rout even in its traditional heartland of Kalyana Karnataka (the north-eastern division of the State). The JD (S), which is part of the BJP alliance, has not been allotted any seat in north Karnataka, where it has a limited support base.\n\nAmong other issues, the BJP highlighted the murder of a Hindu girl named Neha Hiremath by a Muslim classmate in Hubballi. The BJP's star campaigners, such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, also targeted the Congress over issues such as the inheritance tax, even though it has not been mentioned in the Congress manifesto.\n\nThe Congress is hoping to make gains in the part of the State on the back of its implementation of five guarantees. Part of its campaign has also focused on the Prajwal Revanna scandal, with Congress leaders accusing the BJP of endorsing his candidature despite knowing all about his character.\n\nAlso Read | South Karnataka: April 26 to see tough fight for 14 seats\n\nThe incumbents and the challengers\n\nA full list of the constituencies voting on May 7 in Karnataka, with brief details about the candidates, follows:\n\nChikkodi: The BJP has renominated its incumbent MP, Annasaheb Jolle, who, confident of his renomination began his campaign six months ago in this north-west corner of Karnataka. Pitted against him is Priyanka Jarkiholi, a political novice. While the young Congress candidate does not have any political experience, she is the daughter of Karnataka Minister Satish Jarkiholi who, along with his brothers, is a powerhouse in the politics of Karnataka. Jolle is a Lingayat while Jarkiholi is a Valmiki, which is recognised as Scheduled Tribe. Of the eight Assembly constituencies forming part of the Chikkodi parliamentary constituency, five are represented by the Congress while the BJP has three MLAs.\n\nBelagavi: Former Union Minister Suresh Angadi ensured that Belagavi became a BJP fortress by winning from this constituency continuously from 2004. In the byelection that took place after his death, his wife, Mangala Savadi, was victorious in 2021, but this time, the BJP has chosen to field its former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar. Shettar was an aspirant for the neighbouring Dharwad Lok Sabha seat but has been accommodated in Belagavi after he returned from the Congress' fold, which he had joined prior to the Assembly election last year. Shettar is a Lingayat like his Congress opponent, Mrinal Hebbalkar. This will be the first electoral contest for Hebbalkar whose mother, Laxmi Hebbalkar, is a Minister in the Congress government in power in the State.\n\nBagalkot: BJP's four-time winner from this constituency, P.C. Gaddigoudar, takes on political debutant Samyukta Patil of the Congress. Samyukta is the daughter of Shivanand Patil, an incumbent Minister in the Karnataka government, who is putting all his efforts in ensuring her victory. Both the candidates belong to the Lingayat community, with Gaddigoudar belonging to the Ganiga sub-caste and Patil to the Panchamsali sub-caste. Gaddigoudar is banking on his non-controversial and friendly image and the fact that Patil does not belong to Bagalkot to boost his chances of re-election. Samyukta Patil, on the other hand, is focusing on the successful implementation of the Congress' five guarantees.\n\nKarnataka BJP president B.Y. Vijayendra pays tribute to Neha Hiremath, a student who was stabbed to death by a classmate, in Hubballi on April 23. The murder has become a major political rallying point in the run-up to the election. | Photo Credit: PTI\n\nBijapur: The contest in this reserved constituency (SC) is between Ramesh Jigajinagi, a veteran parliamentarian from the BJP, and a Hanumant (Raju) Alagur of the Congress, a former MLA. Jigajinagi is a six-time parliamentarian who belongs to the left-hand agglomeration of Dalits in Karnataka. The Congress, which picked Lambani (considered a touchable Dalit caste) candidates in the past, has changed its strategy this time around. Alagur served as an MLA for two terms and belongs to the right-hand agglomeration of Dalits in Karnataka. The JD (S) has a limited base here but that has eroded after its alliance with the BJP. Lingayats and Dalits are the two largest communities but there are also significant numbers of Muslims and Kurubas.\n\nAlso Read | In Karnataka, it's a battle of 'guarantees'\n\nKalaburagi: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had never lost an election throughout his long political career spanning over five decades until 2019, when Umesh Jadhav of the BJP defeated him in this reserved (SC) constituency by a margin of almost 1 lakh votes. Jadhav has been renominated from the BJP while the Congress has nominated Radhakrishna Doddamani, a choice that surprised many, but the fact that he is Kharge's son-in-law has ensured that any opposition to his candidature has been subdued. Six of the eight MLAs from the constituency are with the Congress, while the BJP and JD (S) have one MLA each. Apart from Dalits. Lingayats and Muslims constitute an important component of the electorate.\n\nRaichur: The contest in this reserved constituency (ST) is interesting because of a quirky coincidence. The Congress' candidate is former civil servant G. Kumar Naik, who was the Deputy Commissioner of Raichur district between 1999 and 2002. His opponent, Raja Amareshwar Naik, the scion of a minor local royal family, was a Minister and district in-charge of Raichur during Kumar Naik's tenure. Thus, the two candidates who worked together while administering the district are now competing against each other. In the Assembly election of 2023, the Congress won five seats while the BJP won two and the JD (S) one. Apart from Valmikis, Dalits, Muslims, Kurubas, and Lingayats are the significant communities in this constituency.\n\nBidar: A political greenhorn from the Congress, 26-year-old Sagar Khandre, who is a third-generation politician, will take on Union Minister Bhagwant Khuba, a Union Minister, who is aiming for a hat-trick victory from this constituency. While Sagar is the candidate, Khuba's real fight is with his father, Eshwar Khandre, Forest and Environment Minister, who is investing all his resources and energy to ensure his son's victory. This is one of the few Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka where the BJP has more MLAs than the Congress. While the BJP emerged victorious in eight Assembly seats in last year's Assembly election, the Congress was able to win in three. Apart from Lingayats. who form the largest chunk of the electorate, Dalits, tribal people, and Muslims are present in significant numbers.\n\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge with party leaders during a public meeting for the Lok Sabha election, in North Kalaburagi on May 4. | Photo Credit: ANI\n\nKoppal: The constituency has been electing candidates from the BJP over the past three Lok Sabha elections but the party suffered a setback after its two-term MP, Karadi Sanganna Amarappa, joined the Congress after he was denied a ticket and the BJP chose Dr Basavaraj Kyavater as its candidate. An orthopaedic, Dr Kyavater is a Lingayat, while his Congress opponent, Rajashekar Hitnal, is a Kuruba. Hitnal contested the 2019 election as well while his father, Basavaraj Hitnal, contested and lost in 2014 against Amarappa. Rajashekar Hitnal is hoping to finally avenge the two defeats that he and his father suffered at the hands of the BJP and is also banking on the consolidation of the votes of backward communities, Muslims, Dalits, and tribal voters.\n\nBellary: In this reserved seat (ST), the BJP's B. Sriramulu will face the Congress' E. Tukaram. Sriramulu became infamous during the iron ore mining scandal that rocked Karnataka in the 2000s because of his intimate relationship with the Reddy brothers but has since transcended the stigma of that association to emerge as a leader of the Valmiki community. Sriramulu's significant political stints as Minister and the entry of Janardhan Reddy's party into the BJP fold has also increased his support base. Tukaram is also a Valmiki and has a clean image in this constituency where both parties have an entrenched support base.\n\nHaveri: This is the first time that a former Chief Minister will be contesting from this constituency in central Karnataka. Basavaraj Bommai of the BJP, who helmed the State from 2021 to 2023, is pitted against a young Congress candidate, Anandaswamy Gaddadevaramath. Both the candidates belong to the Lingayat community. Bommai is focusing on his achievements during his tenure as Chief Minister, while Gaddadevaramath is banking on the solid gains that the Congress made in this constituency's Assembly segments in last year's election, when it won seven of the eight seats. Apart from Lingayats. who form the overwhelming majority, there are large numbers of Dalits, tribal people, and Muslims in the constituency.\n\nDharwad: The BJP's candidate, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, a Brahmin, is hoping for his fifth consecutive victory from this constituency. A young Congress leader, Vinod Asuti, who belong to the backward Kuruba caste, is the challenger. A Lingayat pontiff Fakir Dingaleshwar had filed his nomination papers intending to contest as an independent candidate as he was miffed with the BJP's choice of a Brahmin candidate in this constituency where Lingayats form an overwhelming majority, but he later withdrew his candidature, vowing to ensure the defeat of Joshi. This decision may help consolidate votes in favour of the Congress although the BJP is focusing on the murder of Neha Hiremath, who was a resident of Hubballi which forms part of this constituency, and casting the crime as a larger conspiracy of 'love jehad'.\n\nUttara Kannada: This coastal constituency is considered a safe seat for the BJP as former Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde has won it on six occasions since 1996. Hegde was considered a frontrunner this time as well but was replaced by former Karnataka Assembly Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, after the former's controversial remarks suggesting that the Constitution would be changed if the BJP won more than 400 seats. As this constituency incorporates parts of Belagavi district, where the BJP surges ahead, the Congress picked former MLA Dr Anjali Nimbalkar, who is from Khanapur. as its candidate. The demographic breakup of the constituency is also unique in Karnataka as religious minorities (Muslims and Christians) form the single largest chunk of the voters. There are also significant numbers of Marathas, Dalits, and tribal and Namdhari voters.\n\nGovernment officials on poll duty with equipment allotted to them before moving to their polling booths, in Haveri on May 6. | Photo Credit: Sajay Ritti\n\nDavanagere: This is the only constituency where both the main contenders are women and notably, one of the few constituencies in Karnataka where women voters outnumber men. A Lingayat stronghold of central Karnataka, Davanagere has long been the fiefdom of two families: that of Shamanur Shivashankarappa of the Congress and G.N. Mallikarjunappa of the BJP. The two contestants in the fray now are the daughters-in-law of these patriarchs and thus, the current electoral contest of Davanagere is being seen as a continuation of the battle between these two families. A rebel Congress candidate, G.B. Vinay Kumar, is also in the fray in this constituency where Lingayats, tribal people, Dalits, and Muslims are present in large numbers. Of the eight MLAs from this seat, seven are with the Congress while the BJP has only one MLA.\n\nShivamogga: The entry of BJP rebel candidate K.S. Eshwarappa in what was slated to be a direct and prestigious fight between the children of two former Chief ministers from the BJP and Congress has ensured that Shivamogga has been in the limelight for the past few months. B.Y. Raghavendra, son of former Cheif Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who has represented this constituency thrice, is known for maintaining a low profile and is banking on Lingayat support and avid Hindutva adherents to see him through. His challenger is Geeta Shivarajkumar, who has multiple and illustrious antecedents: she is the daughter of former Chief Minister S. Bangarappa, the daughter-in-law of Kannada film legend Dr Rajkumar and wife of Kannada cinema's reigning star, Shivarajkumar. She is also the and sister of Minister Madhu Bangarappa. She hopes that the large number of Idiga and Muslim voters in the constituency will see her through.\n\nSumming up, the 14 Lok Sabha constituencies of north Karnataka represent the larger political battle being waged across the State. With high-profile candidates (many of whom are political dynasts), intense family rivalries, and crucial caste equations at play, the region promises a thrilling electoral contest between the BJP and the Congress. The performance of these two national parties in this belt will significantly influence the Lok Sabha results. As voters head to the booths on May 7, all eyes will be on whether the BJP can repeat its sweep of 2019 or if the Congress can regain its traditional strongholds through its successful implementation of the give guarantees.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
521,521,"b'Professor Muzaffar Assadi is a Mysuru-based political scientist who has closely observed elections in Karnataka over several decades. He retired earlier this year as Dean, Faculty of Arts, University of Mysore. In an interview with Frontline,Assadi shared his views on some of the major themes in this Lok Sabha election in the State, where voting is in two phases, on April 26 and May 7.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nYou have been observing elections in Karnataka for several decades now. What do you think are some of the important issues for voters?\n\nUsually there is a pattern in Karnataka politics if you study the trend right from the 1970s. Voters focus on national issues during the time of Lok Sabha elections while their focus shifts to State issues in Assembly elections, but I\'m discerning a paradigm shift this time around where the narrative is focussed more on State issues. The Congress is picking up State issues such as the five guarantees and the injustice from the Union government.\n\nThe BJP is banking on Modi\'s charisma and it tried to build a narrative with the issue of the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya but it doesn\'t seem to have caught on. In last year\'s Assembly election in Karnataka, the BJP ran an aggressive campaign focussed on communal issues but it didn\'t work because communal identities cannot take precedence over caste identities here. Prime Minister Narendra Modi compared the Congress\' manifesto to that of the Muslim League\'s but even that is not resonating in Karnataka. Communalism does not work in Karnataka (except for coastal Karnataka) because of the region\'s syncretic culture and history of social movements. Apart from this, the BJP is also on the back foot in Karnataka.\n\nALSO READ: Lingayat seer enters political fray in Dharwad\n\nIn what way is the BJP on the back foot in Karnataka?\n\nThe BJP is suffering from severe internal dissensions. This is evident in constituencies such as Davanagere, Shivamogga, Dharwad, and even in Bengaluru. In Mysuru, a hardcore Hindutva-vaadi [Pratap Simha] was denied the ticket. Union Minister Shobha Karandlaje was not allowed to contest from her home constituency of Udupi-Chikkamagaluru as there was a pushback from local BJP cadre and she has been foisted upon the voters of Bengaluru North. The BJP is not presenting a united front and these divisions are evident. The party is banking only on Modi.\n\nWhy have BJP MPs such as Pratap Simha, Nalin Kumar Kateel, and Anant Kumar Hegde, all aggressive votaries of Hindutva, not been given a chance in this election?\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why BJP has changed these three candidates. First, a singular communal agenda does not work in Karnataka. You cannot have communalism in daily practice. The BJP sensed this after their loss last year. And second, all these MPs have not done any developmental work in their constituencies. Kateel, for instance, spent his entire tenure dealing with a controversy around the construction of a bridge in Mangaluru. And what was his contribution? It was only to further coastal Karnataka\'s reputation as a laboratory of Hindutva. He contributed nothing to the capitalist development of Mangaluru. Or, take someone like the four-time parliamentarian Anant Kumar Hegde, who disappeared for five years and emerged only recently making provocative statements against religious minorities and brazenly advocating for a rectification of the Constitution. There was pent-up anger against these leaders for their non-performance.\n\nApart from a brief period when Kumaraswamy formed a coalition government with Yediyurappa between 2006 and 2008, the JD(S)\' politics has been against the BJP. What were the exigencies that led to the JD(S) entering an alliance with the BJP?\n\nThis is a suicidal attempt by the JD(S) to associate with a national party like the BJP. The BJP\'s political game is clear as they have brazenly decimated and absorbed or succeeded in marginalising regional parties. There are many examples from all over the country.\n\nThe JD(S) identifies with the peasantry and the Vokkaligas, and there is an overlap between these two blocs in the Old Mysore region of Karnataka. The BJP needs the JD(S) to open paths in Old Mysore where the BJP does not have a sufficiently strong presence. The BJP made strong attempts in the past to breach Old Mysore but failed, so the JD(S) becomes important for them in this exercise. The BJP\'s traditional social coalition rests on two castes which I refer to as LIBRA (Lingayats plus Brahmins). In coastal Karnataka, it is BBB (Bunts, Billavas, and Brahmins). If they add Vokkaligas to this, then they will succeed in building up a pre-1970s social coalition in Karnataka consisting of the dominant castes which will be unbeatable. This is their long-term plan.\n\nIn last year\'s Legislative Assembly election, the JD(S) suffered an identity crisis because its support base was hugely dented. Congress Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar is also emerging as an alternative leader of the Vokkaligas and is a major threat to H.D. Kumaraswamy. Thus, the JD(S) entered into an alliance with the BJP, but this also means that it can lose its identity and become a spent force by the time of the next Assembly election in Karnataka.\n\nDo you see any chinks in the Lingayat support base for the BJP? I ask this specifically because in Dharwad a Lingayat pontiff called Fakir Dingaleshwar is contesting as an independent because he feels that Union Minister Pralhad Joshi (a Brahmin) has marginalised the Lingayats.\n\nThe BJP will certainly be concerned about Dharwad because Fakir Dingaleshwar has pitched his candidature using the argument of discrimination. Dingaleshwar is a Lingayat pontiff and mutts have a disproportionate level of influence on people\'s minds. But I don\'t think this will dent the BJP\'s loyal Lingayat support base in constituencies in north and central Karnataka where Lingayats play a decisive role.\n\nALSO READ: \'The BJP has not learnt its lesson\': Priyank Kharge\n\nThe BJP-JD (S) alliance has given tickets to three Brahmins, nine Lingayats, six Vokkaligas, three candidates from the Backward Castes and seven from the Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes. The Congress on the other hand has given its ticket to five Lingayats, eight Vokkaligas, six from the Backward Castes, eight from the Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes, and one Muslim. What do you think of this?\n\nThere is nothing surprising in this as this reflects the social base of the parties. The Congress has solid support among the consolidated social agglomeration known as the AHINDA (Kannada acronym for Religious Minorities, Backward Castes, and Dalits), while the BJP has greater support among Lingayats and Brahmins. That explains the higher number of Backward Caste candidates in the Congress.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the Congress has given its ticket to only one Muslim as the community rallied en masse behind the Congress during last year\'s Assembly election. Rahul Gandhi has been emphasising that representation would be given on the proportionate share of population of various communities. He even coined the slogan ""Jiski Jitni Bhaagidaari, Uski Utni Hissedaari"" but what happened to this idea when it came to Muslims in Karnataka? They should have been given at least one more seat to contest.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was a first-year master of computer applications (MCA) student at the college. The accused, identified as 23-year-old Fayaz (who goes by a single name), reportedly entered the college campus with a knife and wearing a mask, stabbing the woman multiple times in the chest and neck around 3:30 pm, police said. He is an MCA dropout and a resident of Savadatti in Belagavi district.\n\nOn Friday, several organizations and student activists staged protests in the city demanding justice for the victim. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) led a protest calling for a college bandh in the metro area. Other groups such as the Hindu Jagran forum, Sri Ram Sena, and Vishwa Hindu Parishad workers staged demonstrations in front of the BVB College, demanding accountability for the crime.\n\nAs student organizations held rallies demanding justice, the police closed off the entire BVB College Road and installed various security measures.\n\nNeha Hiremath Murder Case: Accused Fayaz\'s Father Apologises, Says Give My Son The Most Severe Punishment\n\nIn Belgaum, ABVP activists blocked roads at Chennamma Circle, demanding stringent action against Fayaz and criticizing the state Congress government\'s handling of the incident.

528,528,"b'For over a week now, there\'s been a flurry of high-profile visits to a two-storeyed house in the Bidnal neighbourhood at the entrance to Hubballi city in Karnataka. On the narrow lane outside the house is a shamiana where a handful of TV crew and reporters wait as one political leader after another drops in to offer condolences to the family of 22-year-old college student Neha Hiremath, whose murder -- captured in gruesome detail on camera -- has shocked people and is roiling the poll cauldron in the region with its virality.\n\nNeha, a BCA student at the B.V. Bhoomaraddi College of Engineering and Technology near Hubballi\'s city centre, was stabbed multiple times allegedly by her former classmate Fayaz Khondunaik on the college campus on April 18. Based on the initial reaction of her father, Niranjan Hiremath, a Congress councillor, who blamed the local police for delay in filing an FIR and not acting swiftly on his complaint of a \'conspiracy\' in the murder, the BJP accused the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government of appeasement and claimed there was a \'love-jihad\' angle to the murder.\n\nFollowing this, several demonstrations condemning the murder and seeking exemplary punishment for Khondunaik -- who was arrested soon after the crime -- were taken out in Hubballi and elsewhere in northern Karnataka towns. Muslim associations in Hubballi too organised a day\'s strike during which businesses downed shutters in solidarity with the family, and put up posters captioned Justice for Neha. Separately, speaking to reporters, Khondunaik\'s mother apologised to Neha\'s family and sought strict punishment for her son. While she said the two had been in a relationship for some time, Neha\'s family has denied the claim.\n\nHubballi city, which falls under Dharwad Lok Sabha constituency, is a BJP bastion represented by Union minister Pralhad Joshi for four terms. Joshi is seeking a fifth term on the back of the Narendra Modi government\'s 10-year track record and his own achievements, such as setting up a National Forensic Sciences University campus in Dharwad district in addition to the Indian Institute of Technology and Indian Institute of Information Technology also in Dharwad, and reducing travel time by train to Bengaluru through line-doubling and electrification.\n\nBut this time around, there had been a curious build-up to the race in Dharwad, with the Dingaleshwara Swamiji, a seer from a religious matha at Balehosur, filing a nomination to contest against Joshi, whom he has accused of neglecting the Lingayats. While Joshi is a Brahmin, Dharwad has a sizeable population of Lingayats, and the entry of the seer into the poll race has threatened to queer the pitch. Meanwhile, the Congress, which has in the past put up Lingayat candidates, this time experimented with a new face -- Vinod Asooti, 34, from the Kuruba community.\n\nHowever, the seer withdrew his nomination at the last moment on April 22, thereby leaving the field open for a straight fight between the BJP and the Congress. Dharwad votes on May 7. The Dingaleshwara Swamiji told reporters that he reconsidered his decision on the advice of the senior pontiff. But, repeating the accusations, the seer said he would continue his \'dharma yuddha\' against Joshi.\n\nAccording to a Lingayat community leader, the seer\'s decision may have also been a fallout of the outcry stemming from the murder of Neha, who belonged to the community. The swamiji is associated with the Shirahatti Fakkireshwar matha, whose origins trace back to about four centuries ago to the reign of the Adil Shahi dynasty in the Deccan, and which follows a tradition of communal harmony with both Hindus and Muslims worshipping there.\n\nThe murder also put the Congress government on the backfoot -- it quickly transferred the case to the criminal investigation department and set up a fast-track court to try the case. While BJP national president J.P. Nadda met Neha\'s family to offer condolences, Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah, ministers H.K. Patil and Laxmi Hebbalkar and Congress state-in-charge Randeep Surjewala too visited Niranjan to assure him of speedy justice.\n\n""This is an unfortunate incident. The case has been handed over to the CID and we will strive for the maximum punishment under law,"" Siddaramaiah told reporters on April 25 after meeting Neha\'s parents. ""The BJP is playing politics with this incident. I will not do that.""\n\nAsked about it, Pralhad Joshi countered: ""On the same day [of the murder], if they (government) had behaved with some sensitivity, the question would have not arisen."" Accusing the Congress of soft-peddling the issue, he claimed the remedial steps came only after \'society at large is showing their anger at what has happened to Neha\'. In his recent campaigns in Karnataka, Prime Minister Modi too has brought up the Neha murder while attacking the Congress government.\n\nOn May 1, Neha\'s parents met Union home minister Amit Shah, who was campaigning in Hubballi. According to reports, Niranjan submitted a memorandum to Shah, appealing for a law for stringent action in such crimes.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

532,532,"b'Yet again, Dharwad Lok Sabha constituency is slated for a straight fight between national parties the BJP and the Congress with both making every effort to woo the demographically strong Veerashaiva-Lingayat community.\n\nUnlike the previous elections, both the national parties have equal representation in the constituency comprising eight Assembly segments. But the ruling party has a formidable opponent in Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, who is making all out efforts to create a record by winning for the fifth time in a row. In the last 17 elections, two other candidates have won four times in a row.\n\nDespite being the largest community in the constituency, Lingayats have elected a man from their community only on three occasions, while three Brahmin candidates have won 10 times and a Kuruba leader has won four times.\n\nPre and post-Idgah row\n\nUntil the 1996 Lok Sabha election, which was held in the aftermath of Idgah riots in Hubballi, Dharwad Lok Sabha (earlier Dharwad North) was the bastion of the Congress party. But the national flag hoisting at Idgah Maidan and the consequent riots, which turned Hubballi-Dharwad into communally sensitive areas, tilted the equations in favour of the saffron party. Ever since, the BJP has registered easy victories with Vijay Sankeshwar, winning it thrice, and Mr. Joshi, winning it four times in a row.\n\nHaving a topography which is mix of Malnad and arid regions, Dharwad Lok Sabha constituency has more urban dwellers, a fact that favours the saffron party, making it possible for a person from a demographically small community winning it. Mr. Joshi\'s winning margin had crossed over two lakhs in the last election.\n\nChanged scenario\n\nThis time too, when the elections were announced, Mr. Joshi whose clout has grown in the recent years, seemed comfortably positioned to win the election hands down, as he is pitted against a political greenhorn Vinod Asuti. But it was until Fakira Dingaleshwar Swami of Shirahatti Fakkireshwar Mutt, calling Mr. Joshi a ""supressor of Lingayats"" said that he would contest against Mr. Joshi.\n\nInitially the seer, the successor of a mutt with syncretic tradition, went hammer and tongs against Mr. Joshi and even filed his nomination papers, a development that rattled the BJP camp, which depends heavily on Lingayats. Much to the relief of Mr. Joshi, the seer subsequently withdrew from the contest, but vowed to continue his \'holy war\' against Mr. Joshi to ensure his defeat in the election.\n\nFollowing these developments, Mr. Joshi is seen in the company of Lingayat leaders more often and his visits to Lingayat mutts have increased. Mr. Joshi has brought in several Lingayat leaders to campaign for him.\n\nMeanwhile, former Minister Vinay Kulkarni, who is forbidden from entering Dharwad district for his alleged involvement in a murder case and who unsuccessfully contested against Mr. Joshi twice, is campaigning virtually, accusing Mr. Joshi of indulging in ""vengeance politics"" and ""dividing and suppressing community leaders.""\n\nRaita Sena Karnataka, which is leading the Mahadayi Kalasa Banduri Nala project agitation, has extended support to the Congress candidate through its political wing Karnataka Samata Paksha.\n\nThe murder\n\nThe brutal murder of a college student Neha Hiremath, daughter of a Congress municipal councillor, by a Muslim youth this month, seems to have altered the political equations a bit with the saffron party playing the ""Hindu-Muslim"" card more vehemently in the last few days. The BJP camp wants to keep the issue alive till the elections are over and has been organising a series of protests and meetings to strengthen the narrative which it has already built. The BJP is accusing the government of ""appeasement politics"" in a clear bid to polarise the votes.\n\nWhile the BJP is trying to keep its support base of Lingayats intact, the Congress, which is banking on the demographically strong Muslims and Kurubas along with support of OBCs, is looking for more support from Veerashaiva Lingayats.\n\nRead Comments'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Au total, 15 millions d\'agents \xc3\xa9lectoraux sont mobilis\xc3\xa9s dans plus d\'un million de bureaux de vote.\n\nMais les r\xc3\xa9sultats qui devraient \xc3\xaatre d\xc3\xa9voil\xc3\xa9s le 4 juin ne font gu\xc3\xa8re de doute. Le parti nationaliste hindou de Modi, le BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) devrait l\'emporter assez largement. Et faire basculer r\xc3\xa9solument le pays ? Selon les derniers sondages le parti du peuple pourrait atteindre le seuil des 400 d\xc3\xa9put\xc3\xa9s, ce qui lui donnerait toute latitude pour r\xc3\xa9former la Constitution.\n\nUne possibilit\xc3\xa9 qui, comme nous vous l\'expliquons dans notre vid\xc3\xa9o en t\xc3\xaate d\'article, nourrit de nombreuses inqui\xc3\xa9tudes alors que Narendra Modi a sap\xc3\xa9 depuis dix ans les piliers de l\'\xc3\xa9quilibre des pouvoirs. Au point que le chercheur sp\xc3\xa9cialiste de l\'Inde, Christophe Jaffrelot, n\'h\xc3\xa9site plus \xc3\xa0 parler dans un article d\'autoritarisme \xc3\xa9lectoral : "" il y a des \xc3\xa9lections, certes, mais l\'\xc3\x89tat de droit est en voie de disparition "".\n\nOppositions et justice affaiblies\n\nDe fait, depuis 10 ans, au service de son projet nationaliste, Narendra Modi a m\xc3\xa9thodiquement affaibli les contre-pouvoirs. Les partis d\'opposition sont r\xc3\xa9guli\xc3\xa8rement vis\xc3\xa9s par des enqu\xc3\xaates.\n\nArvind Kejriwal, l\'un des responsables de la coalition d\'opposition INDIA, form\xc3\xa9e pour rivaliser avec Modi, a m\xc3\xaame \xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 arr\xc3\xaat\xc3\xa9 en mars pour des soup\xc3\xa7ons de pots-de-vin. Rahul Gandhi, le chef du parti du Congr\xc3\xa8s, a d\xc3\xa9plor\xc3\xa9 de son c\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 un gel de ses finances. \xc3\x80 cela s\'ajoute par exemple que 143 des 192 d\xc3\xa9put\xc3\xa9s d\'opposition ont \xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 exclus du Parlement en d\xc3\xa9cembre dernier.\n\nPeu ou prou, les institutions font face \xc3\xa0 la m\xc3\xaame pression et des soup\xc3\xa7ons p\xc3\xa8sent m\xc3\xaame sur la Commission \xc3\xa9lectorale charg\xc3\xa9e de valider l\'\xc3\xa9lection. Autre exemple, en 2017, la Cour supr\xc3\xaame a c\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9, malgr\xc3\xa9 ses r\xc3\xa9ticences, sur les obligations \xc3\xa9lectorales, qui permettaient un syst\xc3\xa8me de financement occulte des partis. L\'instance est finalement revenue en f\xc3\xa9vrier dernier sur sa d\xc3\xa9cision mais entre-temps le BJP aurait amass\xc3\xa9 jusqu\'\xc3\xa0 700 millions d\'euros de donations anonymes. L\'opposition d\xc3\xa9nonce, elle, un scandale m\xc3\xaalant des entreprises vis\xc3\xa9es par des enqu\xc3\xaates financi\xc3\xa8res pour blanchiment d\'argent et des dons colossaux au BJP.\n\nFin du pluralisme\n\nDu c\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 des m\xc3\xa9dias, l\'Inde est \xc3\xa0 la 162e place du classement de Reporters sans fronti\xc3\xa8res, derri\xc3\xa8re, le Pakistan.

Quant aux \xc3\xa9ventuelles manifestations, elles sont r\xc3\xa9prim\xc3\xa9es.\n\nEn parall\xc3\xa8le, Modi sature l\'espace public avec son image, et une communication contr\xc3\xb4l\xc3\xa9e.

Des violences qui prennent aussi une forme politique, avec par exemple, la r\xc3\xa9vocation en 2019, du statut d\'autonomie du Cachemire indien, \xc3\xa0 majorit\xc3\xa9 musulmane, ou plus r\xc3\xa9cemment l\'adoption d\'une loi qui facilite l\'acc\xc3\xa8s \xc3\xa0 la citoyennet\xc3\xa9 de minorit\xc3\xa9s confessionnelles mais en exclut les musulmans.\n\nLa Constitution concentre les craintes\n\nDans ce contexte d\xc3\xa9mocratiquement affaibli, dont les exemples ci-dessus ne sont qu\'une partie visible de l\'iceberg, l\'opposition fait campagne sur le th\xc3\xa8me de "" sauver la d\xc3\xa9mocratie "".

It ends on June 1 and votes will be counted on June 4.\n\nOn Friday, in the largest of the seven phases, 166 million voters in 102 constituencies across 21 states and territories will vote, including in Tamil Nadu in the south, Arunachal Pradesh on the Himalayan frontier with China, and the most populous Uttar Pradesh in the north.\n\nVoters began lining up outside polling stations much before they opened at 7:00 a.m. (0130 GMT) amid tight security, including senior citizens who needed help to reach the booths.\n\n""Modi will come back to power, because apart from the religious push, his other work, including on safety and security is good,"" said Abdul Sattar, 32, a Muslim voter in Uttar Pradesh\'s Kairana, about 100 km (60 miles) from Delhi.\n\nMohammed Shabbir, a 60-year-old driver and father of eight, said unemployment was the main issue for him as none of his children have regular jobs.\n\nHindu nationalism is not an issue in this election, ""because even the Hindus are affected by a lack of jobs"", he said.\n\nSurveys suggest BJP will easily win a majority even though voters have serious concerns about unemployment, inflation and rural distress in the world\'s fastest growing major economy, with the spotlight being on whether BJP can improve on its 2019 victory and by how much.\n\n""In the next five years, we will take our nation into the top three economies of the world, launch a final and decisive assault against poverty, open up newer avenues of growth ... unveil the next generation of reforms, and take a number of pro-people decisions and actions,"" Modi wrote in the BJP\'s election manifesto.\n\nThe manifesto and the theme of the BJP campaign is titled ""Modi Ki Guarantee"" or Modi\'s guarantee to fulfill promises made to voters, underlining the unusual leader-centric, presidential-style pitch in a parliamentary system.\n\n""I urge all those voting ... to exercise their franchise in record numbers,"" Modi posted on X, minutes before polling began.\n\n""I particularly call upon the young and first time voters to vote in large numbers.

BJP hoardings across towns and cities highlight a range of achievements in his two terms, including India\'s historic landing on the moon\'s south pole and fighting corruption to woo voters.\n\nHindu nationalism is a key theme. Modi\'s government and BJP are accused by critics of discriminating against or targeting India\'s 200 million minority Muslims to please their hardline Hindu base - charges both deny. Sporadic violence between Hindus and Muslims continues to break out.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance says the election is an ideological battle being fought to stop the BJP from ending the constitutional and democratic system.\n\nRahul Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party, said the BJP always seeks to divert attention from major issues such as unemployment and price rise.\n\n""Sometimes the PM goes underwater in the ocean and sometimes he is on a seaplane but does not talk about issues,"" Gandhi said, referring to Modi\'s widely publicised engagements in recent months.\n\nWhile the alliance has struggled to forge unity and field common candidates against the BJP, it has accused the government of denying it a level playing field by arresting opposition leaders in corruption cases and making huge tax demands ahead of the vote - charges the government denies.\n\nChandrachur Singh, who teaches politics at Delhi\'s Hindu College, said the BJP has a clear edge but also faces real challenges.\n\n""It\'s not an election where there are no issues,"" he said. ""There are issues which could have led to anti-incumbency. But that is something which is not being channelised or harnessed by a fragmented, divided, weak opposition.""\n\n""That is what is causing some kind of disillusionment among voters and allowing BJP to surge ahead.""\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik in Kairana, Praveen Paramasivam in Chennai and YP Rajesh in New Delhi; Writing by YP Rajesh; Editing by Angus MacSwan)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also said parties had been directed to remove such content within three hours of it being brought to their notice.\n\nModi, the face of the Hindu-nationalist BJP, seeking a rare third consecutive term, had focused his campaign largely on his government\'s performance on economic growth and welfare benefits.\n\nBut he changed tack after the first phase of voting on April 19 and his campaign speeches have since become more polarising on religious lines, accusing Congress of planning to redistribute the wealth of the majority Hindus among minority Muslims, who he called ""infiltrators"" who have ""more children"".\n\nThe videos shared by the BJP over the last ten days, one of which has since been taken down, illustrated the same message.\n\nA 17-second video shared by a state unit of BJP on May 4, with over 8.5 million views, shows a character resembling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi feeding ""funds"" to a bird in a skullcap, which eventually pushes out from their common nest three other birds representing other disadvantaged groups.\n\nThe Congress has filed a police complaint against BJP leaders for the video, BJP\'s head of information and technology Amit Malviya said on X.\n\n""The Congress should in fact thank the BJP for taking their manifesto to the people in a manner that even they couldn\'t,"" he wrote.\n\nThe video has elicited outrage. Nitasha Kaul, a politics professor at London\'s Westminster University said on X that the video was a ""straightforward 1930s Germany style cartoon"".\n\nIn its manifesto for the elections, the Congress has promised to tackle India\'s economic inequality by conducting a socio-economic caste census and extending affirmative action. It said it will ensure that minorities receive ""their fair share"" of education, economic and healthcare opportunities.\n\nAn Election Commission spokesperson, the BJP\'s Malviya and Congress spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik, additional reporting by Shivangi Acharya and Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Toby Chopra)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
558,558,"b'NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is holding the world\'s biggest election starting this month, with nearly 1 billion people eligible to vote and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the pole position.\n\nWHAT IS IT?\n\nElections to the 543 contested seats in the lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha, for a term of five years. To rule, a party or a coalition needs a simple majority of 272 seats. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 303 seats the last time, followed by 52 for the main opposition Indian National Congress (INC).\n\nIn addition to the contested seats, India\'s president can nominate up to two Anglo-Indians to the Lok Sabha.\n\nWHERE AND WHEN IS IT TAKING PLACE?\n\nThe elections will be conducted in seven phases partly to ensure sufficient security at polling booths across the vast country. Voters can make their choice by pressing a button on an electronic voting machine, first used in India in 1982 and more widely since the early 2000s.\n\nVotes will be counted on June 4 after polling is done on April 19, April 26, May 7, May 13, May 20, May 25 and June 1.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nThe world\'s most populous nation follows the first-past-the-post system, where voters cast a vote for a single candidate in a constituency and the candidate with the most votes wins the seat. The voting age is 18 years and contestants need to be at least 25 years old.\n\nA total of 968 million voters are registered, out of which 497 million are men and 471 million are women. A higher percentage of women voters than men are likely to vote for the second time in a row.\n\nWHO ARE THE MAIN CANDIDATES?\n\nModi headlines the race, followed by his de facto deputy Amit Shah and the main opposition face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. Gandhi\'s mother Sonia, the matriarch of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, is not contesting this time.\n\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT?\n\nModi is chasing a record-equalling third straight term like India\'s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Modi says another overwhelming victory for the National Democratic Alliance, led by the BJP, is crucial to meet his goal of lifting India to a developed economy by 2047 from middle-income levels. The world\'s fifth-largest economy has grown fast in the past few years and Modi has ""guaranteed"" to take it to the third position if he wins the election.\n\nThe BJP draws its support mainly from Hindus, who form 80% of the country\'s 1.42 billion people and for whom Modi earlier this year delivered on a key party promise of building a grand Hindu temple on a disputed site.\n\nThe opposition ""INDIA"" alliance, largely a centre-left grouping of more than two dozen disparate parties, says a victory for it is essential to save the country\'s democratic and secular setup, lift its marginalised communities, raise prices for farmers and create jobs for its young. Opinion polls, which have a mixed record in India, predict another thrashing of the Congress alliance at the hands of the BJP.\n\n(Reporting by Krishna N.

Karunanidhi, the state\'s longest-serving chief minister.\n\nBut despite nearly half a century of political experience, his appeal remains limited to his home state.\n\nThe DMK won 23 national seats in 2019, the third largest party with just over two percent.\n\nSeveral of Stalin\'s DMK colleagues, including his son, are subject to ongoing criminal investigations -- that they insist are politically-motivated probes to sideline him.\n\nMamata Banerjee has earned a reputation as an audacious political street fighter able to hold her own in a male-dominated world.\n\nThe wily firebrand spent her youth leading demonstrations in Kolkata against the communist state government.\n\nBanerjee, 69, started her career in the Congress party, winning her first seat in 1984.\n\nBut she later split to start the All Indian Trinamool Congress (AITC) in 1998, and won the top state job in West Bengal in 2011.\n\nShe once forged an alliance with the BJP -- serving in government as railways then coal minister.\n\nBut she is now at loggerheads with Modi, and has repeatedly thwarted the BJP\'s determined attempts to oust her government in West Bengal, one of India\'s most populous states with more than 91 million people.\n\nHer AITC won 22 national seats in 2019, just behind Stalin\'s DMK.\n\n- Arvind Kejriwal -\n\nThe jailed chief minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal once said he would ""never fight an election"", portraying himself as an anti-graft campaigner challenging a corrupt elite.\n\nToday, the 55-year-old former tax official is a formidable challenger -- even from detention, where he has been held since last month.\n\nHe is accused of receiving kickbacks while handing out liquor licences to private companies.\n\nHis Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), or Common Man\'s Party, has twice defeated the BJP to control the capital.\n\nKejriwal has pushed populist policies such as generous electricity subsidies for the poor, winning followers also in the northern state of Punjab.\n\nHe led protracted protests at government graft scandals -- then under the control of the Congress party, today its coalition ally.\n\nBut the AAP\'s key victories have been in state elections, and it has won only two seats in the national parliament.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
560,560,"b'(Reuters) - India, with nearly a billion eligible voters, will set off on the world\'s largest electoral exercise on Friday. The country has more than 2,500 political parties but just 10 of them hold 86% of all seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament.\n\nA serious contest between a few parties will likely be dominated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nBHARATIYA JANATA PARTY (BJP)\n\nThe BJP, the world\'s largest political outfit with nearly 180 million members, was born out of the Jan Sangh party, an offshoot of a men-only Hindu nationalist organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). After struggling on the political margins early after it was formed in 1980, the BJP delivered its first prime minister 16 years later in an unstable government that lasted 13 days.\n\nThe party formed a government with a majority of its own for the first time in 2014 under Modi. It\'s been formidably in power since.\n\nNarendra Modi: Modi, 73, was born and raised in a small town in the western state of Gujarat. He joined the BJP\'s ideological parent, the RSS, in his 20s and the Jan Sangh nearly a decade and a half later.\n\nHe\'s risen through the ranks over years and was Gujarat\'s chief minister for more than three terms before leading the BJP into a decisive victory in the 2014 general election. A decade in power, Modi remains enduringly popular as he seeks a record-equalling third straight term. Pollsters predict an easy win for him and the BJP, powered by consistent wooing of the Hindu majority, strong economic growth and handouts.\n\nModi is seeking to be re-elected from Varanasi, a city of religious significance to Hindus in the populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAmit Shah: A close Modi aide, Shah is India\'s home affairs minister - a position critical to matters of national security. He became the president of the ruling BJP in 2014 after Modi stormed to power and took up a cabinet position in Modi\'s second term in 2019.\n\nShah is credited with helping shepherd Modi\'s Hindu-first agenda such as stripping Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir of its special status as a state and implementing a contentious citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims.\n\nShah is seeking to be re-elected from Gujarat\'s Gandhinagar, the capital of the state.\n\nINDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS\n\nThe Congress is India\'s oldest political party and governed India for more than two-thirds of the years since independence in 1947 but has struggled after Modi swept to power.\n\nCongress gave the its first and only woman prime minister, Indira Gandhi, and introduced comprehensive economic reforms in 1991 making way for the evolution of an open market economy.\n\nBut it crashed out of power in 2014 against the Modi onslaught and a series of corruption allegations.\n\nRahul Gandhi: Modi\'s fiercest opponent and Congress\'s star campaigner, Gandhi has never been a minister in a federal or state government, has not led his party to a general election victory, and quit as party chief after a miserable performance at the last parliamentary polls in 2019.\n\nYet he remains at the centre of India\'s opposition politics and Modi\'s main target. His father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all prime ministers and led the country for more than 37 years.\n\nGandhi, 53, is a four-time parliament member who has struggled to mobilise masses to support a wobbly 26-member opposition alliance he helped stitch together. He set off on two cross-country walks to invigorate his campaign and tap into disenchantment over lack of jobs, income inequality and rural distress.\n\nGandhi is fighting this election from Wayanad in the southern state of Kerala. The matriarch of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, Sonia Gandhi, has decided to not contest in this year\'s election.\n\nAAM AADMI PARTY (AAP)\n\nThe Aam Aadmi or Common Person\'s Party emerged from a strong anti-corruption movement in 2011 that swelled amid protests led by Anna Hazare - a self-styled crusader backed by close aide Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nKejriwal formed the AAP in 2012 and formed a local government in the national capital Delhi in 2015, staging an unexpected political upset for established parties like the BJP and Congress. Kejriwal, who has been Delhi\'s chief minister since, is a staunch Modi critic and a Congress ally in the upcoming elections.\n\nHowever, AAP\'s prospects are clouded by pre-election arrests of most of its high-profile leaders, including Kejriwal, in an alleged graft case.\n\nThe party that also runs Punjab state dismisses the allegations as ""a desperate attempt to malign the image"" of Kejriwal.\n\nDRAVIDA MUNNETRA KAZHAGAM (DMK)\n\nA strong regional force in India\'s south, the DMK is India\'s third-largest party in terms of the number of seats it holds in the lower house of parliament. A Congress ally, DMK also runs Tamil Nadu state, where the poverty rate is 2%, one of the lowest in the nation, and boasts a high literacy rate.\n\nALL INDIA TRINAMOOL CONGRESS (TMC)\n\nIndia\'s fourth-largest party by seats in parliament, the Trinamool Congress holds power in West Bengal in the east, another state the BJP has struggled to crack. The party came into being nearly 25 years ago after it splintered from the Congress.\n\nFounder of the party Mamata Banerjee has been the state head for nearly 13 years and is now a reluctant Congress ally in fighting the BJP in the 2024 polls. Her party has joined the 26-member opposition bloc but failed to clinch an agreement over who will fight from which seat in the state.\n\nOne of the TMC candidates for the election is Mahua Moitra, a persistent critic of Modi. A former investment banker, Mitra was expelled from parliament last year over allegations of accepting bribes from a businessman in exchange for parliamentary questions. Mitra says the charges are trumped-up.\n\n(Writing by Shivangi Acharya; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
561,561,"b'India begins voting Friday in a six-week election, with Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s victory all but assured, raising concerns for the health of the world\'s largest democracy.\n\nModi remains roundly popular after a decade in office that has seen India rise in diplomatic clout and economic power, as well as efforts by his government to bring the country\'s majority faith in ever closer alignment with its politics.\n\nAnalysts have long expected him to win against a fractious alliance of more than two dozen parties who have yet to name a candidate for prime minister.\n\nModi\'s prospects have been further bolstered by several criminal probes into his opponents, sparking concerns from UN rights chief Volker Turk and human rights organisations that the vote will be skewed.\n\n""I don\'t need the United Nations to tell me our elections should be free and fair,"" foreign minister S. Jaishankar told reporters while campaigning this month.\n\n""The people of India will ensure that,"" he added. ""So don\'t worry about it.""\n\nModi, 73, has already led the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through two landslide victories in 2014 and 2019, forged in part by his appeals to the Hindu faithful.\n\nThis year in the town of Ayodhya, he presided over the inauguration of a grand temple to the deity Ram, built on the grounds of a centuries-old mosque razed by Hindu zealots.\n\nConstruction of the temple fulfilled a long-standing demand of Hindu activists and was widely celebrated across India with back-to-back television coverage and street parties.\n\n""The nation is creating the genesis of a new history,"" he told the thousands gathered for the ceremony, among them Bollywood celebrities and cricket stars.\n\n- \'Our ability to fight\' -\n\nThe opposition Congress party, which ruled the country almost uninterrupted for decades after independence from Britain, is meanwhile a shadow of its former self and out of office in all but three of the country\'s 28 states.\n\nIts leaders have stitched together an alliance of more than two dozen regional parties to present a united front against the BJP\'s well-oiled and well-funded electoral juggernaut.\n\nBut the bloc has been plagued by disputes over seat-sharing deals and suffered the defection of a leading member to the government.\n\nIt has also accused Modi\'s government of using law enforcement agencies to selectively target the bloc\'s leaders, several of whom are the subject of active criminal investigations.\n\nAmong them is Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was arrested last month and remains in custody on allegations his party received kickbacks while handing out liquor licences to private companies.\n\nRahul Gandhi is the most prominent Congress politician, and his father, grandmother and great-grandfather all served as prime minister.\n\nHe was briefly disqualified from parliament last year after being convicted of criminal libel.\n\nHis party\'s bank accounts have been frozen since February by India\'s income tax department after a dispute over returns that were filed five years ago.\n\n""We have no money to campaign, we cannot support our candidates,"" the 53-year-old told reporters last month. ""Our ability to fight elections has been damaged.""\n\n- \'Contempt for all dissent\' -\n\nModi\'s tenure has seen India overtake former colonial ruler Britain as the world\'s fifth-biggest economy, with Western nations lining up to court a prospective ally against regional rival China\'s growing assertiveness.\n\nIn doing so, they have sidestepped concerns over the taming of India\'s once-vibrant press and restrictions on civil society that have seen rights groups like Amnesty severely curtail their local operations.\n\nLast year, the tax office raided the BBC\'s local offices weeks after the British broadcaster aired a documentary questioning Modi\'s role in 2002 religious riots that killed around 1,000 people, most of them Muslims.\n\nShould Modi win again, his third term ""will be even more characterised by contempt for all dissent"", political scientist Suhas Palshikar told AFP.\n\nGandhi has criticised the government for democratic backsliding and its chest-thumping Hindu nationalism, which have left many among the country\'s 220-million-strong Muslim minority fearful for their futures.\n\nBut Gandhi has already led Congress to two defeats against Modi and his efforts to dent the premier\'s popularity have failed to register with voters.\n\nPublished opinion polls are rare in India, but a Pew survey last year found Modi was viewed favourably by nearly 80 percent of the public.\n\nA total of 968 million people are eligible to vote in the election -- more than the entire population of the United States, European Union and Russia combined.\n\nVoting will be staggered over seven stages between April 19 and June 1, with more than a million polling stations across the country.\n\nBallots from around the country will be counted all at once on June 4 and are usually announced on the same day.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

568,568,"b'NEW DELHI (AP) -- Millions of Indians began voting Friday in the second round of multi-phase national elections as polarization grows with Prime Minister Narendra Modi whipping up an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics in his campaign.\n\nPeople lined up outside polling stations as voting opened at 7 a.m. The turnout was expected to pick up as the day progresses.\n\nThe outcome of Friday\'s voting across 88 constituencies in 13 states with 160 million voters will be crucial for Modi\'s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.\n\nMost polls predict a win for Modi and the BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.\n\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi is contesting from Wayanad constituency in southern Kerala state for a second time after he was defeated in 2019 elections by Smriti Irani, a BJP leader, in the northern Indian city of Amethi -- a traditional stronghold for the Nehru-Gandhi family.\n\nOther key leaders in the second phase of voting include Shashi Tharoor of the Congress party and BJP\'s popular Bollywood star Hema Malini and actor Arun Govil, who had played the role of Hindu\'s most revered Lord Ram in a 1987 television adaptation of the ancient epic Ramayana.\n\nThe BJP already won one parliamentary seat from Surat in Gujarat state, where the Congress party candidate was disqualified Monday. Election officials said they found discrepancies in the signatures on the nomination and other candidates pulled out of the contest, leaving the BJP nominee as the winner.\n\nNearly 970 million voters -- more than 10% of the world\'s population -- will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years during the staggered election that runs until June 1. The votes will be counted on June 4. There are a total of 28 states in India.\n\nThe turnout of the first phase of polling on April 19 was estimated around 62% of 166.3 million eligible voters.\n\nBy comparison, India\'s 2019 national election registered the highest-ever voter turnout -- 67.11% -- in the history of Indian parliamentary elections. The turnout is expected to increase for five more rounds of voting.\n\nThe voters\' apathy has surprised some political analysts, but they say that the BJP remains a front-runner.\n\n""You could argue that the listlessness is a consequence of a foregone conclusion,"" said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, an Indian academician.\n\n""But for Modi\'s party which is expecting to win 400 of the 543 seats the joyous surge is missing,"" he said in an article in the Indian Express daily.\n\nModi stirred a huge controversy over the weekend when he said that the Congress party, if voted to power, would distribute the country\'s wealth among ""infiltrators"" and ""those who have more children,"" in an apparent reference to the Muslim community.\n\nHindus comprise 80% of India\'s 1.4 billion people, Muslims 14% and Christians and Sikhs 2% each.\n\nThe Congress party leaders met with election officials and urged them to investigate whether Modi\'s comments violated the body\'s code of conduct that bars politicians from appealing to voters based on caste and religious feelings.\n\nThe BJP also filed a complaint against Congress party leader Gandhi. It accused Gandhi of falsely asserting an increase in poverty in the nation and driving a wedge between the North and South of India based on language and region, aiming to disrupt the electoral environment.\n\nThe election authority recognized the complaints on Thursday and asked the presidents of the two parties to file their responses by Monday. The authority is expected to give its ruling next week.\n\nCritics of the prime minister -- an avowed Hindu nationalist -- say India\'s tradition of diversity and secularism has come under attack since his Bharatiya Janata Party won power a decade ago. They accuse the party of fostering religious intolerance and sometimes even violence. The party denies the accusation and says its policies benefit all Indians.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
569,569,"b'CNN --\n\nThe world\'s biggest election kicks into gear next week when the first ballots are cast in India\'s mammoth national polls, considered the most consequential in decades with the potential to shape the country\'s future.\n\nNearly 1 billion people are eligible to decide whether to grant Prime Minister Narendra Modi a rare third consecutive term in office and extend the 10-year rule of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nUnder Modi, India has become the world\'s fastest growing major economy, pushing the country of 1.4 billion people to near-superpower status.\n\nBut India has also become increasingly polarized along religious lines and critics say another five-year term will give Modi\'s right-wing BJP a mandate to continue its policies that have transformed the country from a secular republic to a Hindu-first nation.\n\nHere\'s what you need to know about the largest election in human history:\n\nHow does India vote?\n\nIndia\'s national elections are a giant exercise in democracy and logistics that take over a month to complete.\n\nAbout 968 million people are eligible to vote -- more than the populations of the United States, the European Union and Russia combined.\n\nGiven the size of the electorate, there isn\'t a single date when everyone will vote. Instead, polling will unfold over seven phases around the country, beginning on April 19 and ending on June 1. All the votes from the country\'s 28 states and eight union territories will be counted and results released on June 4.\n\nUnder a multi-party, first-past-the-post system, Indians will vote to fill 543 of 545 seats in the lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha, with two other seats nominated by the country\'s president.\n\nThe party with the majority will form a government and appoint one of its winning candidates as prime minister.\n\nVoters register at a polling station in Hyderabad on April 11, 2019. Noah Seelam/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWho are the contenders?\n\nModi and his BJP remain hugely popular and he is widely expected to secure another five years in power.\n\nThe 73-year-old was first elected prime minister in 2014 with a roaring majority on a ticket of development and anti-corruption. He is credited with implementing welfare and social reforms, and easily secured a second term in 2019, this time on a more apparent platform of Hindu nationalism.\n\nIn that election more than 67% of Indians cast their ballot -- the highest voter turnout in the country\'s history.\n\nThe main challenger to the BJP is the Indian National Congress, which has governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence but now finds itself in the doldrums.\n\nIn an effort to prevent another Modi win, the Congress formed an alliance with other opposition leaders, including major regional parties. The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA, launched its campaign late last month on a platform of ""saving democracy.""\n\nPolitical scion Rahul Gandhi is the face of the Congress party but other key figures include popular leader of the Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nThere are also regional heavyweights such as the West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress\' Mamata Banerjee and the south\'s Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, who will be vying to block a BJP takeover in their respective states where Modi is yet to break through.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi addresses his supporters during an election campaign rally in Pushkar on April 6, 2024. Himanshu Sharma/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow strong is the opposition?\n\nThe INDIA bloc has been beset by infighting and is yet to put forward its candidate for prime minister. Analysts say it is struggling to match the kind of star quality and appeal projected by Modi.\n\nThe opposition is also under pressure from what it says is a campaign by the BJP to weaken Modi\'s opponents.\n\nSeveral prominent members of the opposition, including Delhi chief minister Kejriwal, have been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties. The Congress had its bank accounts frozen by federal tax authorities and said it was asked to pay a further $218 million in taxes.\n\nThe BJP has denied political interference.\n\nMeanwhile, another victory for Modi would cement his place as one of India\'s most important and longest-serving leaders.\n\nModi\'s party and its allies are aiming to win more than 400 seats in the Lok Sabha -- giving them enough votes to change India\'s constitution.

Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nWhat are the main issues?\n\nIndia is the world\'s largest democracy but over a decade of BJP rule, analysts say the populist Modi has tightened his grip on its democratic institutions.\n\nMinorities, especially the country\'s 200 million Muslims, say they have been persecuted under the BJP\'s Hindu-nationalist policies.\n\nAnd Modi has been accused of silencing his critics including cracking down on India\'s independent media. In the annual World Press Freedom Index, India has dropped from 140th in 2014 -- the year Modi came to power -- to 161 out of 180 nations in last year\'s list.\n\nFrom demolishing Islamic monuments, to renaming cities founded by ancient Muslim rulers and revising history textbooks, Modi\'s rule has been a seismic shift for India, from its secular founding values to that of a Hindu-first nation. Analysts say another BJP term will push India further along this road.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party, Indian National Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party flags fly in Delhi on March 27, 2021.

They say his presence on the world stage -- including hosting the G20 -- has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing.\n\nModi has also delivered on many of his key promises, with his crowning achievement the inauguration of the controversial Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a Hindu temple in the holy city of Ayodhya that was built on the site of the destroyed Babri mosque.\n\nBut while India\'s economy is rising, the world\'s most populous country has failed to generate enough jobs for the millions of young people struggling to enter the workforce. Unemployment among 20- to 24-year-olds was a staggering 44.4% at the end of 2023.\n\nFarmers have also emerged as the biggest threat to the ruling party in recent years, repeatedly taking to the streets to demand stronger protection of their economic welfare including higher fixed prices for their crops.\n\nAgriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 55% of India\'s population and farmers have previously had success strong-arming Modi into repealing unpopular agriculture policies.\n\nParty symbols and voting at 15,000 feet\n\nIndia\'s election is believed to be the world\'s most expensive, even outstripping US presidential elections. In 2019, political parties, candidates and regulatory bodies spent up to $8.6 billion, according to the Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies. This year, spending is expected to surge past that.\n\nFrom the high peaks of the Himalayas to the remote forests of India\'s central states, votes are cast electronically across more than 1 million polling stations. Some 15 million election workers will be deployed, traveling via road, boat, camel, train and helicopter to reach every Indian voter.\n\nAt 15,256 feet (4,650 meters), Tashigang, a village in the far northern state of Himachal Pradesh on the border with China, was the world\'s highest polling station when its residents voted in 2022 state government elections.\n\nIn 2019, more than 8,000 candidates contested the election. This year, candidates are still being announced, but more than 2,700 parties will fight it out for seats in the Lok Sabha, including six national and more than 70 state parties.\n\nElection officials carry Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) and other election material, followed by paramilitary personnel, in Lohore Sapori, Assam on April 10, 2019.

570,570,"b'Varanasi and New Delhi CNN --\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi once famously made a simple election promise: ""good days are coming"".\n\nTo his adoring supporters, it\'s a vision of a future now finally within reach should Modi and his right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secure an emphatic and rare third consecutive term at this month\'s nationwide election.\n\nAt his rallies, tens of thousands gather in near frenzied religious devotion in support of a man whose policies they say have transformed the lives of ordinary Indians - and helped enshrine the nascent promise of social mobility in a country still riven by caste divisions.\n\nModi projects himself as an outsider from humble origins. Born as the son of a tea seller in a small town in Gujarat, he does not fit neatly within the often privately educated, resolutely metropolitan, English-speaking template set by many previous Indian leaders.\n\nThe 74-year-old is unmarried, has no children, and seemingly shuns expensive material possessions in favor of a simple, ascetic lifestyle.\n\nAnd though little is shared about Modi the man - his private life is assiduously guarded by a formidable public relations team - his persona resonates with many.\n\nHis political rise in some ways mirrors India\'s own path from a newly independent nation freed from the shackles of colonialism to a confident, secure country inching ever closer to superpower status - albeit one wracked by deep and abiding fault lines.\n\nIndia\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses his supporters during an election campaign rally in Pushkar on April 6, 2024. Himanshu Sharma/AFP/Getty Images\n\nModi, his opponents argue, has done little to soothe those divisions.\n\nReligious persecution and Islamophobia have increased sharply on his watch, with many accusing the prime minister of tacitly endorsing sectarianism as a means of further bolstering his Hindu-nationalist credentials, while diverting from policy failures - such as youth unemployment, which now stands at close to 50% among 20- to 24-year-olds.\n\nAmong India\'s minorities, particularly the country\'s 230 million Muslims, the prospect of another five-years for a prime minister who calls himself the ""chowkidar"" - or watchman - remains deeply concerning.\n\nMany don\'t believe Modi is watching out for them - instead, they say they are marginalized as he fulfills his party\'s dream of transforming secular, pluralistic India into a majoritarian Hindu state.\n\n""As he goes toward seeking a third term, Prime Minister Modi has positioned himself as a head priest alongside the head of the political system ... the protector of the nation (and), as the creator of a Hindu-first nation,"" said Saba Naqvi, author of ""The Saffron Storm: From Vajpayee to Modi.""\n\nThis seemingly potent, populist mix of economic empowerment and Hindu nationalism has proved to be a successful electoral formula for Modi, confounding longstanding social and regional voting lines.\n\nAccording to 2023 Pew research, about eight-in-ten Indian adults have a favorable view of Modi, including 55% who have a very favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\n\n""He\'s done something which has not happened before in Indian politics among all our prime ministers,"" said Naqvi. ""He has willfully created a cult of his own personality.""\n\n\'Many people think he is God\'\n\nAs the sun sets across the Ganges, Hindu devotees bathe in the holy river\'s waters and priests offer daily prayer by its banks. It\'s here, in the city of Varanasi - Modi\'s own constituency - that this so-called cult of personality is on full display.\n\nBillboards with the prime minister\'s face appear on the corners of roads, and saffron flags with his party\'s lotus symbol are hoisted on buildings across the dusty, meandering gulleys of the ancient city.\n\nOn the streets, his party\'s volunteers go door-to-door advocating for the leader.\n\nWhen Modi first ran for prime minister a decade ago, he did so on a promise of infrastructure, development and anti-corruption, choosing the city of gods as his constituency - its religious symbolism the perfect backdrop for his BJP\'s Hindu nationalist ambitions.\n\nIn one of Varanasi\'s oldest spice markets, shopkeepers say their lives have been transformed since.\n\nVaranasi BJP President Dileep Patel at his office, in front of a Modi cutout. John Mees/CNN\n\n""Many people think he is God,"" said father of two, Akash Jaiswal, pointing to Modi\'s welfare schemes and business incentives. ""We\'ve never had a prime minister like Modi ever. He\'s done a great sacrifice for India, for us ... We want him to be prime minister forever.""\n\nJaiswal even praised some of Modi\'s most controversial leadership moments. ""India had the least casualties during Covid,"" he said, when in fact the country had the third highest number of pandemic-related deaths, after the United States and Brazil, according to the World Health Organization. Modi was highly criticized for his handling of the pandemic and accused of being underprepared, as hospitals reached their limit and morgues overflowed with bodies.\n\nThe city\'s BJP President, Dileep Patel, who has helped Modi with all three of his election campaigns, however, isn\'t surprised by his enduring levels of popularity. To him, Modi represents India\'s future.\n\n""Today India is strong, capable, and self-reliant under the prime minister\'s leadership,"" he said.\n\nIndia\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.

Amr Alfiky/Reuters Narendra Modi, in pictures Prev Next\n\nSon of a teaseller\n\nModi\'s official party biography tells the story of a poor boy, the third of six children, whose father was a ""chaiwallah"" or tea seller, who\'d serve customers at the local train station to support his young family\n\nPromoted by the BJP, analysts say this tale of humble beginnings makes him relatable to hundreds of millions across the country. And it stands in stark contrast to the generations of India\'s elite, urbane politicians that have historically risen to the top job.\n\n""He comes from a poor background and that helps him understands the people of India,"" said Varanasi BJP president Patel.\n\nIndia\'s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a member of the Indian National Congress, a political party that was pivotal in ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, also became prime minister, as did her son, Rajiv. All three studied overseas at Cambridge or Oxford.\n\nThe face of today\'s Congress Party, and Modi\'s primary opponent, is Rahul Gandhi, son of Rajiv, and an alumni of both Cambridge and Harvard.\n\nModi, by contrast, had a modest upbringing in the small town of Vadnagar, far from the political cut and thrust of the capital New Delhi, according to Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of ""Narendra Modi: The Man, The Times.""\n\nMukhopadhyay notes Modi was an average student at school and his marriage was arranged to a woman at 17.\n\nThough Mukhopadhyay claims the tale of Modi\'s poverty is ""grossly exaggerated,"" his charisma - and confidence - was evident from an early age.\n\n""He liked acting in school plays,"" said Mukhopadhyay. ""He always wanted to have the lead role. If the lead role was not given to him, he would not act in the play at all.""\n\nModi was still a child when he was exposed to the idea of Hindu nationalism through classes at the local branch of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing paramilitary organization that advocates for the establishment of Hindu hegemony within India.\n\nFounded in 1925 by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, a campaigner who had split from Nehru\'s Congress party over what he believed to be ""undue pampering of the Muslims,"" its central mission is to ""nourish the Hindu culture,"" according to the group\'s website.\n\nAt 17, Modi abandoned his family and his wife, left his village and traversed India with the group in search of a spiritual awakening, according to his biography. He devoted himself to the RSS, never remarried and learned to ""leave all the pleasures in life,"" according to an interview he gave in 2019.\n\nBy 1972, he had become a ""pracharak"" for the RSS, according to his biography, someone appointed to spread their cause through meetings and public lectures.\n\nThe turning point for the young activist came in 1975, when then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi invoked what she called necessary ""shock treatment"" to stamp out internal unrest. She imposed a state of emergency, tightening government control, rounding up critics, censoring her opposition and silencing the press.\n\nDetached from the demands of marriage, Modi then 25, saw an opportunity, according to his biography. He joined a movement to restore democracy to India, his profile states, marking the start of his journey to political high office.\n\nAnd in the absence of a family life, many of his supporters have claimed him as part of their own, adding to his everyman appeal. ""Modi is our family,"" said the shopkeeper Jaiswal in Varanasi. ""We are all his family.""\n\nEntry into the BJP\n\nModi joined the BJP in 1987, when the fringe political party started gaining traction fueled by the rise of Hindu nationalism in India.\n\nConsidered to be the political arm of the RSS, the BJP gained prominence that decade when it advocated for the destruction of the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque believed by Hindus to have been built on the site of the birthplace of the religion\'s revered Lord Ram.\n\nAnd it was thrust into the mainstream in 1992, when - spurred on by members of the BJP - Hindu hardliners attacked the mosque, ripping it apart with their hands, and setting off a wave of sectarian violence that reverberated through the nation.\n\nIndia\'s next prime minister and BJP co-founder Lal Krishna Advani in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, May 20, 2014. AP\n\nOne of the BJP\'s founders Lal Krishna Advani - widely believed to be the brains behind the mosque\'s destruction - saw a leader in Modi, giving him immense responsibilities within the party.\n\nNo politician ""brings the experience that Modi does,"" Naqvi, the author, said last month from her home in New Delhi, referring to his various political roles.\n\nModi thrived under Advani\'s guidance, working his way through the ranks of the BJP. In 2001, he was appointed chief minister of the wealthy state of Gujarat.\n\nUnder Modi\'s governance, the state introduced a wave of infrastructure, industry, and innovation to its arid landscape - making the ""Gujarat model"" synonymous with development and government efficiency.\n\nHis tenure was not without controversy.\n\nViolence erupted in Gujarat in 2002 when Hindus blamed Muslims for setting fire to a train in an incident that killed dozens of Hindu pilgrims and sought revenge by attacking Muslim-owned homes and stores.\n\nMore than 1,000 people - mostly Muslims - were killed, according to government figures. Critics accused Modi of being complicit in the violence, alleging that his administration failed to prevent or adequately respond to the unrest.\n\nThen Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi waves to supporters in Kadi, Gujarat state, on September 9, 2002. Amit Dave/Reuters\n\nModi faced international repercussions in its aftermath, with the United States banning him from entering the country for many years over concerns about human rights violations.\n\nHe vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and the Supreme Court cleared him of complicity. Months after the violence, he was re-elected with a roaring majority - the ""first evidence"" of his cult following, said Naqvi, the author.\n\nBut the polarization of communities deeply divided the nation, leaving scars that persist to this day.\n\nPolitical scientist Christophe Jaffrelot suggested events in Gujarat made Hindu nationalists more confident. ""But Modi himself is so insecure, he cannot face any questions,"" he said.\n\nModi infamously walked out of an interview in 2007, when journalist Karan Thapar pressed him on his role in the Gujarat riots. He rarely gives interviews, and has not held a solo press conference since becoming Prime Minister.\n\n""He cannot face debate,"" Jaffrelot said.\n\nBecoming prime minister\n\nModi\'s ""Gujarat model"" had become a blueprint for India and in 2014, the BJP won by a landslide, crushing the Congress - the party\'s worst defeat in more than 100 years of its existence.\n\nSince entering into office, Modi\'s administration has upgraded the country\'s aging transport network, building highways connecting small villages with major cities. His administration has built new power plants and maritime projects, and, according to recent remarks from Modi himself, subsidized the construction of some 40 million concrete homes for improvised families.\n\nThe administration also bolstered the country\'s military capabilities. And it\'s invested money in sports, science and high-end technology - letting India thrive on the world stage.\n\nBut for some observers, a troubling pattern has also emerged.\n\nNarendra Modi casts his vote in the general election in Ahmedabad on April 30, 2014. Amit Dave/Reuters\n\n""He was able to popularize Hindu nationalistic politics and their ideology,"" said Mukhopadhyay, the writer and unofficial Modi biographer.\n\nModi appointed Hindu nationalists to top positions in government, giving them the power to make sweeping changes to legislation, instilling a sense of fear among the 230 million Muslims living in the country.\n\nIn 2019, he roared through polls yet again - this time on a more clearly defined ticket of Hindu supremacy.\n\nHe abrogated the special autonomy of Kashmir - India\'s only Muslim-majority state - bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi. His government implemented a controversial citizenship law considered by many to be discriminatory against Muslims.\n\nHe built the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on the site of the destroyed mosque, reviving painful memories of 1992\'s bloodshed for many Muslims, but brought a sense of pride for millions of Hindu devotees.\n\nAnd to his more vocal critics, Modi\'s economic policies are also open to question. Despite India now boasting an economy that is projected to grow 7.3% this fiscal year - the highest rate among major global economies - accusations persist that Modi has failed to create enough jobs, or adequately bridge the gap between the country\'s billionaire class and its most improvised.\n\n""He has made the poor, poorer. He has increased inequalities,"" said Jaffrelot, in reference to the country\'s wealth gap, which according to a recent study is more unequal than it was during British rule.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, he\'s grown closer to the US, been wooed by Australia and courted by the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the same time, Modi has kept India\'s historically close relationship with Russia -- snapping up huge amounts of Moscow\'s oil despite the Ukraine invasion -- and he maintains relations with both Israel and other Middle Eastern countries at a time of increased polarization.\n\nPresident Joe Biden visits Raj Ghat memorial with Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and other G20 leaders in New Delhi on Sept. 10, 2023.

A recent Morning Context poll ranked Modi as the world\'s most popular global leader, with an approval rating of 76% at home.\n\n""He\'s the number one figure right now. He\'s the only candidate for prime minister,"" Naqvi said.\n\nAt a Modi rally in the northern city of Ghaziabad earlier this month, thousands of supporters thronged the large grounds as he walked on stage. Some dressed as the Indian god Ram, others head to toe in saffron, the official color of his BJP, their triumphant cries reverberating through the air.\n\nIn the city of Meerut in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, a Modi supporter says she is voting for him because he is ""unlike any other politician in the world.""\n\n""I have put Modi\'s poster in my son\'s room,"" Raniva, who is 36 and goes by one name, said. ""The way (he) is doing so much for the country, I hope my son also does good work for the country.""\n\nOn the streets of the capital New Delhi, opinion is more divided. ""Nowadays there is so much fighting between Hindus and Muslims. We all know why,"" said one rickshaw driver sitting outside the city\'s famed Jama Mosque.\n\nWith Modi widely expected to comfortably win the upcoming election, some analysts say they have genuine fears about the future of the country\'s democracy.\n\n""I definitely see a decline in the quality of democracy in the country,"" said Mukhopadhyay. ""I see greater insecurity and marginalization of Muslims in India. That\'s not a very rosy picture. But it\'s the likely path India is going to take.""\n\nCNN\'s Sania Farooqui contributed reporting from Meerut.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
571,571,"b'CNN --\n\nUnder the searing New Delhi sun, more than a dozen of India\'s top opposition leaders joined hands in a rare show of unity imploring voters to ""save democracy.""\n\nStanding before thousands of supporters at the city\'s historic and politically important Ramlila Maidan, the March 31 rally marked the opposition\'s strongest attempt yet to sway voters against electing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third straight term.\n\nThe consequence of continued Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule, they say, would be the erosion of the very foundation upon which modern India was built: democracy.\n\n""This election is for saving democracy and we must fight united,"" main opposition party Indian National Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge told the crowds, who were waving the party flag of orange, white and green. ""There is no level playing field in this election.""\n\nIt echoed a similar rally more than 40 years earlier on the same spot, when opposition leaders fired up huge crowds to help change the course of the 1977 election - ending the 10-year rule of India\'s powerful third prime minister and political scion Indira Gandhi.\n\nGandhi had imposed a state of emergency, jailed key opposition leaders and curtailed civil freedoms. To some, India\'s future was perched on a needle point between autocracy and democracy. She lost the election and, in the eyes of many, India\'s democracy was saved.\n\nTo many supporters in the crowd three weeks ago, India is now at a similar crossroads with this high-stakes election deciding which path the country follows.\n\n""Our democracy is being murdered, India is becoming a dictatorship,"" Hazari Lal Rajput, a resident from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, told CNN at the Ramlila Maidan.\n\nSupporters of India\'s opposition party, Indian National Congress, during an election rally in Puducherry on April 15, 2024 R.

Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\n\nBut India\'s opposition leaders accuse Modi\'s right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles ahead of elections, which began on April 19 and run until June 1, with results counted on June 4.\n\nThey also warn Modi\'s brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting.\n\nIndia\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.

Amr Alfiky/Reuters Narendra Modi, in pictures Prev Next\n\nModi and the BJP have denied political interference, with one senior party leader saying it was a ""process of law"" to take ""appropriate action against corruption.""\n\nTo counter the BJP, the opposition has formed a 27-member bloc -- the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA.\n\nBut so far that alliance has proved lackluster, observers say. It has been beset by ideological differences, has seen a host of defections to the BJP and, even with the election in full swing, has yet to even name a prime ministerial candidate.\n\n""What kind of a democracy can you have if you don\'t have a vibrant opposition, a robust opposition that can question the government?"" asks Arati Jerath, an independent political commentator and journalist.\n\n""That\'s why it\'s not really a question of whether Modi wins or not, it\'s a question of keeping the opposition alive to fight another day so that democracy in India survives.""\n\n\'Scorched earth\'\n\nAmong those leading the charge for the opposition alliance is Rahul Gandhi, longtime face of the Congress and the latest member of his family to bid for power.\n\nHe is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India\'s first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country\'s founding prime minister.\n\n""If the BJP wins these fixed elections and changes the constitution, the country will be on fire. Remember this,"" Rahul Gandhi told the crowd in Delhi last month.\n\nThe BJP and its allies are gunning for a supermajority of more than two-thirds of the seats in India\'s parliament, the Lok Sabha. A rising fear among critics is that this would give the BJP the power to change India\'s constitution, which is rooted in the democratic principles of justice, liberty, equality and - crucially - secularism.\n\nThe BJP has repeatedly denied it has plans to change the constitution.\n\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaks during a press conference in New Delhi on March 25, 2023. Money Sharma/AFP/Getty Images\n\n""When I say that I have big plans, no one should be scared. I don\'t take decisions to scare or run over anyone, I take decisions for the wholesome development of the nation,"" Modi said in an interview with Indian news agency ANI earlier this week.\n\nBut the party has already begun publicly pulling India\'s government away from its secular foundation and leading BJP figures have openly advocated for the country to be declared a Hindu nation.\n\n""There shouldn\'t be politics on the basis of religion in any country, they should talk about real issues. Until people\'s financial situation improves, there won\'t be any social reform,"" said voter Mohammad Irfan at the opposition rally in Delhi.\n\nOpposition parties have found themselves facing a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year\'s election.\n\nGandhi\'s Congress - the largest party in the INDIA alliance -- has accused the BJP of ""tax terrorism"" and crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. It has also been landed with a $218 million tax bill.\n\nThen came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\n\nKejriwal\'s detention on graft allegations came after the announcement of the general election last month, sparking protests in the capital. Analysts say it\'s the first time in post-independence history that an Indian chief minister has governed from behind bars.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal speaks during a protest against alleged attacks on federalism by the federal government, in New Delhi, India, on February 8, 2024. Altaf Qadri/AP\n\nKejriwal has denied the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. He is just one of several prominent members of the opposition, including three other senior AAP leaders, that have also been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties.\n\n""I think there are very serious concerns about how free and fair the elections are going to be in India this time around,"" said Atishi, Delhi minister of education for the AAP, who goes by one name.\n\nReports have emerged of opposition party members being coerced into joining the BJP with the threat of arrest, while they were under investigation by state agencies. Other reports suggest politicians have had their probes dropped after switching sides.\n\nAtishi said she was also approached to switch to the BJP. ""Either you join the ruling party, and then the cases are closed or put into cold storage or if you don\'t, like the Aam Aadmi Party leaders, then the cases go ahead and you\'re arrested and put into jail,"" she said, without specifically naming who approached her.\n\nCNN cannot independently confirm the incidents and has reached out to the BJP for comment.\n\nIn his interview with ANI, Modi denied any sliding of democracy under his rule and emphasized the independence of the Election Commission and state agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate, saying political leaders make up just 3% of cases.\n\n""Shouldn\'t we let the ED work independently when it is supposed to do so?"" he said. ""I am convinced that corruption has destroyed the country. We should fight against corruption with our full strength.""\n\nAnalyst Jerath said a BJP-led campaign to weaken the opposition was part of Modi\'s ""scorched earth policy.""\n\n""Just wipe out whatever comes in your way so that this juggernaut can move on without any kind of challenge, without any obstruction,"" she said.\n\nGandhi \'not a contender\'\n\nModi is enduringly popular, analysts say, appealing to both the poor and the affluent, especially among much of the roughly 80% of India\'s population who are Hindu.\n\nDuring his 10 years in power, he has launched a raft of welfare policies including free food handouts, housing, cheap gas cylinders for women and infrastructure projects.\n\nIndia is also the world\'s fastest-growing major economy and Modi\'s presence on the world stage -- including hosting the G20 -- has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing.\n\nAuthor Christophe Jaffrelot told CNN Modi makes people feel ""proud again of being Indian.""\n\n""There is a sense in India, a constant sense, of vulnerability, a lack of self-esteem. So to be recognized as a great power in spite of everything, (that) is attributed to him,"" he said.\n\nThat does not mean there aren\'t key issues the opposition could rally around, analysts say, including the BJP\'s failure to increase education opportunities or improve health infrastructure - especially following the coronavirus pandemic, which hit India especially hard.\n\nYouth unemployment also remains a huge problem, close to 50% among 20-to-24-year-olds.\n\nBut the INDIA alliance has failed to capitalize on these weak spots, Jerath said.\n\n""They haven\'t been able to weave together a cohesive kind of campaign, come up with a catchy slogan that will fire the imagination of the voting public,"" she said.\n\nCongress leader Gandhi is one of the few opposition figures considered to have the kind of star power and name recognition to stand against Modi.\n\nBut though he may have the name, Gandhi lacks leadership skills, some analysts say.\n\nRasheed Kidwai, journalist and author of ""24 Akbar Road,"" a history of the Congress party, said it\'s a winner-takes-all election and there is ""no silver medal in politics.""\n\n""The problem with INDIA alliance is there is nobody who has that kind of hunger, who has that kind of personal(ity), who has that kind of inner sense of belonging or ownership to go in this election. Rahul is doing it but is not a contender,"" he said.\n\nGandhi recently completed a 6,713-kilometer (4,200-mile) walk across the country, starting in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur, to raise issues of poverty, unemployment, diversity and democracy with voters.\n\nDespite these efforts, the BJP has dominated the campaign narrative.\n\nA key gauge of opposition strength will be in those parts of India where the BJP has historically failed to make inroads.\n\nSupporters of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) participate in an election campaign rally on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri, India, on April 16, 2024. Diptendu Dutta/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nRegional opposition heavyweights, such as the West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress head Mamata Banerjee and the south\'s Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, will be vying to block a BJP takeover in their respective states.\n\nBut the only other major national party is the Congress, which has been the main opposition since 2014.\n\nCongress governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence, and while it was once a powerful political force with its legacy rooted in the formation of modern India, it now finds itself in the doldrums, dogged by infighting and accusations of corruption within the party.\n\n""In the Congress, the best and brightest are not fighting the election,"" Kidwai said.\n\nAnalysts say that during a decade in opposition, Congress has failed to rebuild its organization and political machinery to effectively take on the BJP.\n\nThe Congress organization has ""decayed and almost died over the years, particularly in north India, and particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest, most populous state,"" Jerath said.\n\n""There was a time after independence, and for many years after independence, that they used to say that you would find a Congress flag in every single village in India,"" she said. ""That\'s no longer true.""\n\nStill, there is optimism from some.\n\nThe AAP\'s Atishi said that despite repeated attacks against her party, it has been able to defeat the BJP in Delhi again and again.\n\n""Democracy becoming an autocracy ... That is what we are fighting against,"" she said. ""I think that the people of India have always voted very sensibly, and we hope that they do so this time.""\n\nCNN\'s Kunal Sehgal, Aishwarya S.

572,572,"b'CNN --\n\nPolice in southern India are investigating a senior leader of the country\'s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over a campaign video targeting Muslims, as critics accuse Prime Minister Narendra Modi of running an increasingly divisive election.\n\nThe police probe comes as the world\'s most populous nation votes in a mammoth weeks-long election in which Modi\'s Hindu-nationalist ruling party is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term.\n\nThe party has long denied being anti-Islam but opposition politicians and prominent Muslims have warned that its leaders have been deploying openly divisive rhetoric to turbo-charge their campaign.\n\nAccording to a police report seen by CNN on Tuesday, Karnataka state police are investigating whether local BJP leader B. Y. Vijayendra and the unnamed holder of the party\'s official local X account ""promoted enmity"" between religious groups after the clip was posted online on May 4.\n\nThe 17-second animation depicts leaders of India\'s main opposition Congress party giving benefits to Muslims, alongside a caption in the local Kannada language: ""Beware... Beware... Beware...!""\n\nIt shows caricatures of Congress\'s national leader Rahul Gandhi and its Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah feeding ""funds"" to a large bird wearing a Muslim skullcap, while giving nothing to three smaller birds portraying other marginalized minorities. The large bird then kicks the other birds out of their nest as the Congress politicians laugh.\n\nThe video was removed Wednesday after a request to X from India\'s Election Commission to take it down.\n\nCNN has reached out to Vijayendra, the BJP and X for comment.\n\nCritics said Congress\' manifesto makes no mention of redistributing wealth to Muslims, while Congress lawmaker Manickam Tagore said the video was a ""blatant demonization of minorities by ruling BJP,"" and urged the Election Commission to address its ""divisive tactics.""\n\nMany of India\'s more than 200 million Muslims have expressed fear at the prospect of Modi\'s re-election, and critics said the video fits a pattern of openly Islamophobic rhetoric during the BJP\'s campaign.\n\nLast month, the BJP\'s Instagram account published another animation that claimed the Congress planned to prioritize Muslims.\n\n""If you are a non-Muslim, Congress will snatch your wealth and distribute it to Muslims,"" said a voiceover in the clip, which has since been removed from Instagram.\n\nThat video echoed similar comments by Modi, who sparked a row over hate speech last month while campaigning in BJP-ruled Rajasthan state, when he accused Muslims - who have been present in India for centuries - of being ""infiltrators"" who deliberately have large families to outgrow the majority Hindu population.\n\nModi\'s speech ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants.\n\nThe election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations.\n\nIn an interview with local broadcaster Times Now on Monday, Modi said the BJP is ""not opposed to Islam and Muslims.""\n\nBut many Muslims were skeptical.\n\n""This is not a dogwhistle, this is a targeted, direct, brazen hate speech against a community,"" prominent Muslim journalist Rana Ayyub said in response to the speech.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
573,573,"b'Benar\xc3\xa9s y Nueva Delhi (CNN) -- El primer ministro de la India, Narendra Modi, prometi\xc3\xb3 una vez en las elecciones que ""vendr\xc3\xadan d\xc3\xadas buenos"".\n\nPara sus seguidores, se trata de la visi\xc3\xb3n de un futuro al alcance de la mano si Modi y su partido nacionalista hind\xc3\xba de derechas, el Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), consiguen un tercer mandato consecutivo en las elecciones nacionales de este mes.\n\nEn sus m\xc3\xadtines, decenas de miles de personas se congregan en una devoci\xc3\xb3n religiosa casi fren\xc3\xa9tica en apoyo de un hombre cuyas pol\xc3\xadticas, dicen, han transformado la vida de los indios de a pie y han ayudado a consagrar la incipiente promesa de movilidad social en un pa\xc3\xads todav\xc3\xada desgarrado por las divisiones entre castas.\n\nModi se presenta como un hombre de or\xc3\xadgenes humildes. Nacido como hijo de un vendedor de t\xc3\xa9 en una peque\xc3\xb1a ciudad de Gujarat, no encaja perfectamente en el modelo, a menudo de educaci\xc3\xb3n privada, decididamente metropolitano y angloparlante, establecido por muchos l\xc3\xadderes indios anteriores.\n\nModi, de 73 a\xc3\xb1os, es soltero, no tiene hijos y aparentemente reh\xc3\xbaye las posesiones materiales costosas en favor de un estilo de vida sencillo y asc\xc3\xa9tico.\n\nY aunque poco se sabe de Modi como hombre: su vida privada est\xc3\xa1 asiduamente protegida por un formidable equipo de relaciones p\xc3\xbablicas, su personalidad tiene resonancia en muchos.\n\nSu ascenso pol\xc3\xadtico refleja en cierto modo la trayectoria de la India, que ha pasado de ser una naci\xc3\xb3n reci\xc3\xa9n independizada y liberada de los grilletes del colonialismo a convertirse en un pa\xc3\xads seguro y confiado que se acerca cada vez m\xc3\xa1s al estatus de superpotencia.\n\nModi, argumentan sus oponentes, ha hecho poco por apaciguar esas divisiones.\n\nLa persecuci\xc3\xb3n religiosa y la islamofobia han aumentado dr\xc3\xa1sticamente bajo su mandato, y muchos acusan al primer ministro de respaldar t\xc3\xa1citamente el sectarismo como medio de reforzar sus credenciales nacionalistas hind\xc3\xbaes, desviando al mismo tiempo la atenci\xc3\xb3n de los fracasos pol\xc3\xadticos, como el desempleo juvenil, que ahora se sit\xc3\xbaa cerca del 50% entre los j\xc3\xb3venes de 20 a 24 a\xc3\xb1os.\n\nEntre las minor\xc3\xadas de la India, en particular los 230 millones de musulmanes del pa\xc3\xads, la perspectiva de otros cinco a\xc3\xb1os para un primer ministro que se llama a s\xc3\xad mismo ""chowkidar"" o vigilante, sigue siendo muy preocupante.\n\nMuchos no creen que Modi vele por ellos, sino que los margina mientras cumple el sue\xc3\xb1o de su partido de transformar la India laica y pluralista en un Estado mayoritariamente hind\xc3\xba.\n\n""En su camino hacia un tercer mandato, el primer ministro Modi se ha posicionado como sacerdote junto al jefe del sistema pol\xc3\xadtico... como protector de la naci\xc3\xb3n (y) como creador de una naci\xc3\xb3n hind\xc3\xba"", afirma Saba Naqvi, autora de ""The Saffron Storm: De Vajpayee a Modi"".\n\nEsta mezcla aparentemente potente y populista de empoderamiento econ\xc3\xb3mico y nacionalismo hind\xc3\xba ha demostrado ser una f\xc3\xb3rmula electoral de \xc3\xa9xito para Modi, al trastocar las antiguas l\xc3\xadneas de voto social y regional.\n\nSeg\xc3\xban una investigaci\xc3\xb3n de Pew Research 2023, aproximadamente ocho de cada diez adultos indios tienen una opini\xc3\xb3n favorable de Modi, incluido un 55% que tiene una opini\xc3\xb3n muy favorable. Tales niveles de popularidad para un primer ministro en funciones durante dos mandatos desaf\xc3\xadan todas las convenciones modernas, tanto en la India como en gran parte del mundo democr\xc3\xa1tico.\n\n""Ha hecho algo que no hab\xc3\xada ocurrido antes en la pol\xc3\xadtica india entre todos nuestros primeros ministros"", dijo Naqvi. ""Ha creado voluntariamente un culto a su propia personalidad"".\n\nMientras el sol se pone por el Ganges, los devotos hind\xc3\xbaes se ba\xc3\xb1an en las aguas del r\xc3\xado sagrado y los sacerdotes ofrecen la oraci\xc3\xb3n diaria en sus orillas. Es aqu\xc3\xad, en la ciudad de Benar\xc3\xa9s, la circunscripci\xc3\xb3n electoral de Modi, donde el llamado culto a la personalidad est\xc3\xa1 en plena exhibici\xc3\xb3n.\n\nVallas publicitarias con el rostro del primer ministro aparecen en las esquinas de las carreteras, y banderas azafr\xc3\xa1n con el s\xc3\xadmbolo del loto de su partido se izan en los edificios de los polvorientos y serpenteantes barrancos de la antigua ciudad.\n\nEn las calles, los voluntarios de su partido van de puerta en puerta abogando por el l\xc3\xadder.\n\nCuando Modi se present\xc3\xb3 por primera vez a primer ministro hace una d\xc3\xa9cada, lo hizo con una promesa de infraestructuras, desarrollo y lucha contra la corrupci\xc3\xb3n, y eligi\xc3\xb3 la ciudad de los dioses como circunscripci\xc3\xb3n electoral: su simbolismo religioso era el tel\xc3\xb3n de fondo perfecto para las ambiciones nacionalistas hind\xc3\xbaes de su BJP.\n\nEn uno de los mercados de especias m\xc3\xa1s antiguos de Benar\xc3\xa9s, los comerciantes afirman que sus vidas se han transformado desde entonces.\n\n""Mucha gente cree que es Dios"", afirma Akash Jaiswal, padre de dos hijos, refiri\xc3\xa9ndose a los planes de bienestar social y los incentivos empresariales de Modi. ""Nunca hemos tenido un primer ministro como Modi. Ha hecho un gran sacrificio por India, por nosotros... Queremos que sea primer ministro para siempre"".\n\nJaiswal incluso alab\xc3\xb3 algunos de los momentos de liderazgo m\xc3\xa1s controvertidos de Modi. ""India fue el pa\xc3\xads con menos v\xc3\xadctimas durante el covid"", dijo, cuando en realidad el pa\xc3\xads fue el tercero con m\xc3\xa1s muertes relacionadas con la pandemia, despu\xc3\xa9s de Estados Unidos y Brasil, seg\xc3\xban la Organizaci\xc3\xb3n Mundial de la Salud. Modi fue muy criticado por su gesti\xc3\xb3n de la pandemia y acusado de no estar suficientemente preparado, ya que los hospitales llegaron a su l\xc3\xadmite y las morgues se desbordaron de cad\xc3\xa1veres.\n\nSin embargo, el presidente del BJP de la ciudad, Dileep Patel, que ha ayudado a Modi en sus tres campa\xc3\xb1as electorales, no se muestra sorprendido por sus niveles perdurables de popularidad. Para \xc3\xa9l, Modi representa el futuro de la India.\n\n""Hoy la India es fuerte, capaz y autosuficiente bajo el liderazgo del primer ministro"", afirm\xc3\xb3.\n\nLa biograf\xc3\xada oficial del partido de Modi cuenta la historia de un ni\xc3\xb1o pobre, el tercero de seis hermanos, cuyo padre era un ""chaiwallah"" o vendedor de t\xc3\xa9, que atend\xc3\xada a los clientes en la estaci\xc3\xb3n de tren local para mantener a su joven familia.\n\nLa historia de sus or\xc3\xadgenes humildes, promovida por el BJP, le hace cercano a cientos de millones de personas en todo el pa\xc3\xads, seg\xc3\xban analistas. Y contrasta fuertemente con las generaciones de pol\xc3\xadticos indios de \xc3\xa9lite y urbanitas que hist\xc3\xb3ricamente han llegado a lo m\xc3\xa1s alto.\n\n""Procede de un entorno pobre y eso le ayuda a entender al pueblo indio"", afirm\xc3\xb3 Patel, presidente del BJP de Varanasi.\n\nEl primer primer ministro de la India, Jawaharlal Nehru, fue miembro del Congreso Nacional Indio, un partido pol\xc3\xadtico que fue fundamental para poner fin a casi 200 a\xc3\xb1os de dominio colonial brit\xc3\xa1nico. Su hija, Indira Gandhi, tambi\xc3\xa9n fue primera ministra, al igual que su hijo, Rajiv. Los tres estudiaron en el extranjero, en Cambridge u Oxford.\n\nEl rostro del actual Partido del Congreso, y principal oponente de Modi, es Rahul Gandhi, hijo de Rajiv y antiguo alumno de Cambridge y Harvard.\n\nModi, por el contrario, tuvo una educaci\xc3\xb3n modesta en la peque\xc3\xb1a ciudad de Vadnagar, lejos del ambiente pol\xc3\xadtico de la capital, Nueva Delhi, seg\xc3\xban Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, autor de ""Narendra Modi: The Man, The Times"".\n\nMukhopadhyay se\xc3\xb1ala que Modi era un estudiante mediocre en la escuela y que su matrimonio fue concertado con una mujer a los 17 a\xc3\xb1os.\n\nAunque Mukhopadhyay afirma que la historia de la pobreza de Modi es ""tremendamente exagerada"", su carisma y confianza eran evidentes desde una edad temprana.\n\n""Le gustaba actuar en las obras del colegio"", dice Mukhopadhyay. ""Siempre quer\xc3\xada ser el protagonista. Si no se lo daban, no actuaba en la obra"".\n\nModi era a\xc3\xban un ni\xc3\xb1o cuando conoci\xc3\xb3 la idea del nacionalismo hind\xc3\xba a trav\xc3\xa9s de las clases de la rama local de la Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), una organizaci\xc3\xb3n paramilitar de derechas que aboga por el establecimiento de la hegemon\xc3\xada hind\xc3\xba en la India.\n\nFundada en 1925 por Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, un activista que se hab\xc3\xada separado del partido del Congreso de Nehru por lo que consideraba ""un trato demasiado indulgente a los musulmanes"", su misi\xc3\xb3n central es ""nutrir a la cultura hind\xc3\xba"", seg\xc3\xban el sitio web del grupo.\n\nA los 17 a\xc3\xb1os, Modi abandon\xc3\xb3 a su familia y a su esposa, dej\xc3\xb3 su pueblo y recorri\xc3\xb3 la India con el grupo en busca de un despertar espiritual, seg\xc3\xban su biograf\xc3\xada. Se dedic\xc3\xb3 al RSS, nunca volvi\xc3\xb3 a casarse y aprendi\xc3\xb3 a ""dejar todos los placeres de la vida"", seg\xc3\xban una entrevista que concedi\xc3\xb3 en 2019.\n\nEn 1972, se hab\xc3\xada convertido en ""pracharak"" del RSS, seg\xc3\xban su biograf\xc3\xada, alguien designado para difundir su causa a trav\xc3\xa9s de reuniones y conferencias p\xc3\xbablicas.\n\nEl punto de inflexi\xc3\xb3n para el joven activista lleg\xc3\xb3 en 1975, cuando la entonces primera ministra Indira Gandhi invoc\xc3\xb3 lo que denomin\xc3\xb3 necesario ""tratamiento de choque"" para acabar con el malestar interno. Impuso el estado de emergencia, reforzando el control gubernamental, acorralando a los cr\xc3\xadticos, censurando a la oposici\xc3\xb3n y silenciando a la prensa.\n\nAjeno a las exigencias del matrimonio, Modi, que entonces ten\xc3\xada 25 a\xc3\xb1os, vio una oportunidad, seg\xc3\xban su biograf\xc3\xada. Se uni\xc3\xb3 a un movimiento para restaurar la democracia en la India, afirma su perfil, lo que marc\xc3\xb3 el inicio de su camino hacia los altos cargos pol\xc3\xadticos.\n\nY a falta de una vida familiar, muchos de sus seguidores lo consideran parte de la suya, lo que aumenta su atractivo como hombre corriente. ""Modi es nuestra familia"", dijo el tendero Jaiswal en Varanasi. ""Todos somos su familia"".\n\nModi se afili\xc3\xb3 al BJP en 1987, cuando este partido pol\xc3\xadtico marginal empez\xc3\xb3 a ganar adeptos impulsado por el auge del nacionalismo hind\xc3\xba en la India.\n\nConsiderado el brazo pol\xc3\xadtico del RSS, el BJP adquiri\xc3\xb3 relevancia en esa d\xc3\xa9cada cuando abog\xc3\xb3 por la destrucci\xc3\xb3n de Babri Masjid, una mezquita del siglo XVI que, seg\xc3\xban los hind\xc3\xbaes, se construy\xc3\xb3 en el lugar donde naci\xc3\xb3 Rama.\n\nEn 1992, los partidarios hind\xc3\xbaes de la l\xc3\xadnea dura, alentados por miembros del BJP, atacaron la mezquita, la destrozaron con sus manos y desencadenaron una ola de violencia sectaria que repercuti\xc3\xb3 en todo el pa\xc3\xads.\n\nUno de los fundadores del BJP, Lal Krishna Advani, al que muchos consideran el cerebro de la destrucci\xc3\xb3n de la mezquita, vio en Modi a un l\xc3\xadder, y le otorg\xc3\xb3 inmensas responsabilidades dentro del partido.\n\nNing\xc3\xban pol\xc3\xadtico ""aporta la experiencia que tiene Modi"", dijo Naqvi, la autora, el mes pasado desde su casa de Nueva Delhi, refiri\xc3\xa9ndose a sus diversos cargos pol\xc3\xadticos.\n\nModi prosper\xc3\xb3 bajo la direcci\xc3\xb3n de Advani, abri\xc3\xa9ndose camino en las filas del BJP. En 2001 fue nombrado ministro principal del rico estado de Gujarat.\n\nBajo el gobierno de Modi, el estado introdujo una oleada de infraestructuras, industria e innovaci\xc3\xb3n en su \xc3\xa1rido paisaje, convirtiendo el ""modelo Gujarat"" en sin\xc3\xb3nimo de desarrollo y eficacia gubernamental.\n\nSu mandato no estuvo exento de pol\xc3\xa9mica.\n\nLa violencia estall\xc3\xb3 en Gujarat en 2002, cuando los hind\xc3\xbaes culparon a los musulmanes de incendiar un tren en un incidente en el que murieron decenas de peregrinos hind\xc3\xbaes, y buscaron venganza atacando viviendas y tiendas de propiedad musulmana.\n\nSeg\xc3\xban cifras del gobierno, murieron m\xc3\xa1s de 1.000 personas, en su mayor\xc3\xada musulmanes. Los cr\xc3\xadticos acusaron a Modi de ser c\xc3\xb3mplice de la violencia, alegando que su administraci\xc3\xb3n no supo prevenir ni responder adecuadamente a los disturbios.\n\nTras los disturbios, Modi tuvo que hacer frente a las repercusiones internacionales: Estados Unidos le prohibi\xc3\xb3 la entrada en el pa\xc3\xads durante muchos a\xc3\xb1os por su preocupaci\xc3\xb3n por las violaciones de los derechos humanos.\n\nModi neg\xc3\xb3 con vehemencia haber cometido delito alguno y la Corte Suprema lo absolvi\xc3\xb3 de complicidad. Meses despu\xc3\xa9s de la violencia, fue reelegido con una mayor\xc3\xada aplastante, la ""primera prueba"" de su culto, seg\xc3\xban Naqvi, la autora.\n\nPero la polarizaci\xc3\xb3n de las comunidades dividi\xc3\xb3 profundamente a la naci\xc3\xb3n, dejando cicatrices que persisten hasta hoy.\n\nEl polit\xc3\xb3logo Christophe Jaffrelot sugiri\xc3\xb3 que los acontecimientos de Gujarat dieron m\xc3\xa1s confianza a los nacionalistas hind\xc3\xbaes. ""Pero el propio Modi es tan inseguro que no puede enfrentarse a ninguna pregunta"", afirm\xc3\xb3.\n\nModi abandon\xc3\xb3 una entrevista en 2007, cuando el periodista Karan Thapar le pregunt\xc3\xb3 por su papel en los disturbios de Gujarat. Rara vez concede entrevistas y no ha dado ninguna rueda de prensa en solitario desde que es primer ministro.\n\n""No puede enfrentarse a un debate"", afirm\xc3\xb3 Jaffrelot.\n\nEl ""modelo de Gujarat"" de Modi se hab\xc3\xada convertido en un modelo para la India y, en 2014, el BJP gan\xc3\xb3 por una amplia mayor\xc3\xada, aplastando al Congreso, la peor derrota del partido en sus m\xc3\xa1s de 100 a\xc3\xb1os de existencia.\n\nDesde su llegada al poder, el gobierno de Modi ha modernizado la anticuada red de transportes del pa\xc3\xads, construyendo autopistas que conectan las peque\xc3\xb1as aldeas con las grandes ciudades. Su Gobierno ha construido nuevas centrales el\xc3\xa9ctricas y proyectos mar\xc3\xadtimos y, seg\xc3\xban declaraciones recientes del propio Modi, ha subvencionado la construcci\xc3\xb3n de unos 40 millones de viviendas de concreto para familias sin recursos.\n\nEl gobierno tambi\xc3\xa9n ha reforzado las capacidades militares del pa\xc3\xads. Y ha invertido dinero en deportes, ciencia y tecnolog\xc3\xada punta, lo que ha permitido a India prosperar en la escena mundial.\n\nPero para algunos observadores, tambi\xc3\xa9n ha surgido un patr\xc3\xb3n preocupante.\n\n""Fue capaz de popularizar la pol\xc3\xadtica nacionalista hind\xc3\xba y su ideolog\xc3\xada"", afirma Mukhopadhyay, escritor y bi\xc3\xb3grafo no oficial de Modi.\n\nModi nombr\xc3\xb3 a nacionalistas hind\xc3\xbaes para ocupar altos cargos en el gobierno, d\xc3\xa1ndoles el poder de hacer cambios dr\xc3\xa1sticos en la legislaci\xc3\xb3n, infundiendo una sensaci\xc3\xb3n de miedo entre los 230 millones de musulmanes que viven en el pa\xc3\xads.\n\nEn 2019, volvi\xc3\xb3 a arrasar en las urnas, esta vez con una propuesta m\xc3\xa1s claramente definida de supremac\xc3\xada hind\xc3\xba.\n\nDerog\xc3\xb3 la autonom\xc3\xada especial de Cachemira, el \xc3\xbanico estado de mayor\xc3\xada musulmana de la India, y lo puso bajo el control directo de Nueva Delhi. Su gobierno aplic\xc3\xb3 una controvertida ley de ciudadan\xc3\xada que muchos consideran discriminatoria para los musulmanes.\n\nConstruy\xc3\xb3 el Templo Ram en Ayodhya, en el lugar donde estaba la mezquita destruida, reviviendo para muchos musulmanes los dolorosos recuerdos del derramamiento de sangre de 1992, pero aportando un sentimiento de orgullo a millones de devotos hind\xc3\xbaes.\n\nPara sus cr\xc3\xadticos m\xc3\xa1s ac\xc3\xa9rrimos, la pol\xc3\xadtica econ\xc3\xb3mica de Modi tambi\xc3\xa9n es cuestionable. A pesar de que la econom\xc3\xada india crecer\xc3\xa1 un 7,3% este a\xc3\xb1o fiscal, la tasa m\xc3\xa1s alta de las principales econom\xc3\xadas mundiales, persisten las acusaciones de que Modi no ha creado suficientes puestos de trabajo ni ha salvado adecuadamente la brecha entre la clase multimillonaria del pa\xc3\xads y los m\xc3\xa1s empobrecidos.\n\n""Ha hecho a los pobres m\xc3\xa1s pobres. Ha aumentado las desigualdades"", dijo Jaffrelot, en referencia a la brecha de riqueza del pa\xc3\xads, que seg\xc3\xban un estudio reciente es m\xc3\xa1s desigual que durante la dominaci\xc3\xb3n brit\xc3\xa1nica.\n\nEn el frente diplom\xc3\xa1tico, se ha acercado a Estados Unidos, ha sido cortejado por Australia y el Reino Unido.\n\nAl mismo tiempo, Modi ha mantenido la relaci\xc3\xb3n hist\xc3\xb3ricamente estrecha de la India con Rusia, adquiriendo enormes cantidades de petr\xc3\xb3leo de Mosc\xc3\xba a pesar de la invasi\xc3\xb3n de Ucrania, y mantiene relaciones tanto con Israel como con otros pa\xc3\xadses del Medio Oriente en un momento de creciente polarizaci\xc3\xb3n.\n\nY una abrumadora mayor\xc3\xada de indios parece respaldar su liderazgo. Una encuesta reciente de Morning Consult situaba a Modi como el l\xc3\xadder mundial m\xc3\xa1s popular, con un \xc3\xadndice de aprobaci\xc3\xb3n del 76% en su pa\xc3\xads.\n\n""Es la figura n\xc3\xbamero uno en estos momentos. Es el \xc3\xbanico candidato a primer ministro"", afirm\xc3\xb3 Naqvi.\n\nEn un mitin de Modi en la ciudad de Ghaziabad a principios de mes, miles de simpatizantes abarrotaron el gran recinto cuando subi\xc3\xb3 al escenario. Algunos iban vestidos como el dios indio Rama, otros de la cabeza a los pies vestidos de azafr\xc3\xa1n, el color oficial de su BJP, y sus gritos de triunfo retumbaban en el aire.\n\nEn la ciudad de Meerut, en el estado norte\xc3\xb1o de Uttar Pradesh, una seguidora de Modi dice que le vota porque es ""distinto a cualquier otro pol\xc3\xadtico del mundo"".\n\n""Puse el p\xc3\xb3ster de Modi en la habitaci\xc3\xb3n de mi hijo"", dijo Raniva, que tiene 36 a\xc3\xb1os y responde a un solo nombre. ""De la forma en que (\xc3\xa9l) est\xc3\xa1 haciendo tanto por el pa\xc3\xads, espero que mi hijo tambi\xc3\xa9n haga un buen trabajo por el pa\xc3\xads"".\n\nEn las calles de la capital, Nueva Delhi, la opini\xc3\xb3n est\xc3\xa1 m\xc3\xa1s dividida. ""Hoy en d\xc3\xada hay muchos enfrentamientos entre hind\xc3\xbaes y musulmanes. Todos sabemos por qu\xc3\xa9"", dijo un conductor de rickshaw sentado frente a la famosa mezquita Jama de la ciudad.\n\nAnte la expectativa generalizada de que Modi gane c\xc3\xb3modamente las pr\xc3\xb3ximas elecciones, algunos analistas afirman tener verdaderos temores sobre el futuro de la democracia del pa\xc3\xads.\n\n""Veo sin duda un deterioro de la calidad de la democracia en el pa\xc3\xads"", afirma Mukhopadhyay. ""Veo una mayor inseguridad y marginaci\xc3\xb3n de los musulmanes en la India. No es un panorama muy halag\xc3\xbce\xc3\xb1o. Pero es el camino probable que va a tomar la India"".'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
574,574,"b'(CNN) -- Las elecciones m\xc3\xa1s grandes del mundo arrancar\xc3\xa1n la pr\xc3\xb3xima semana con la emisi\xc3\xb3n de los primeros votos en los gigantescos comicios nacionales de la India, considerados los m\xc3\xa1s importantes en d\xc3\xa9cadas y con el potencial de marcar el futuro del pa\xc3\xads.\n\nCasi mil millones de personas pueden decidir si conceden al primer ministro Narendra Modi un tercer mandato consecutivo y prorrogan los 10 a\xc3\xb1os de gobierno de su Partido Bharatiya Janata (BJP).\n\nBajo el mandato de Modi, India se ha convertido en la gran econom\xc3\xada de m\xc3\xa1s r\xc3\xa1pido crecimiento del mundo, lo que ha llevado a este pa\xc3\xads de 1.400 millones de habitantes a convertirse casi en una superpotencia.\n\nPero la India tambi\xc3\xa9n se ha polarizado cada vez m\xc3\xa1s por motivos religiosos, y los cr\xc3\xadticos afirman que otro mandato de cinco a\xc3\xb1os dar\xc3\xa1 al derechista BJP de Modi un mandato para continuar con sus pol\xc3\xadticas, que han transformado el pa\xc3\xads de una rep\xc3\xbablica laica a una naci\xc3\xb3n hind\xc3\xba.\n\nEsto es lo que hay que saber sobre las mayores elecciones de la historia de la humanidad:\n\nLas elecciones nacionales de la India son un gigantesco ejercicio de democracia y log\xc3\xadstica que dura m\xc3\xa1s de un mes.\n\nPueden votar unos 968 millones de personas, m\xc3\xa1s que la poblaci\xc3\xb3n de Estados Unidos, la Uni\xc3\xb3n Europea y Rusia juntas.\n\nDado el tama\xc3\xb1o del electorado, no hay una fecha \xc3\xbanica en la que todo el mundo vaya a votar. Los comicios se desarrollar\xc3\xa1n en siete fases en todo el pa\xc3\xads, desde el 19 de abril hasta el 1 de junio. El recuento de los votos de los 28 estados y los ocho territorios de la Uni\xc3\xb3n se har\xc3\xa1 p\xc3\xbablico el 4 de junio.\n\nCon arreglo al sistema multipartidista de mayor\xc3\xada relativa, los indios votar\xc3\xa1n para cubrir 543 de los 545 esca\xc3\xb1os de la c\xc3\xa1mara baja del parlamento, llamada Lok Sabha, y otros dos esca\xc3\xb1os ser\xc3\xa1n designados por el presidente del pa\xc3\xads.\n\nEl partido que obtenga la mayor\xc3\xada formar\xc3\xa1 gobierno y nombrar\xc3\xa1 primer ministro a uno de sus candidatos ganadores.\n\nModi y su BJP siguen siendo enormemente populares y se espera ampliamente que se asegure otros cinco a\xc3\xb1os en el poder.\n\nModi, de 73 a\xc3\xb1os, fue elegido primer ministro por primera vez en 2014 con una mayor\xc3\xada aplastante gracias a su pol\xc3\xadtica de desarrollo y lucha contra la corrupci\xc3\xb3n. Se le atribuye la implementaci\xc3\xb3n de reformas sociales y de bienestar, y se asegur\xc3\xb3 f\xc3\xa1cilmente un segundo mandato en 2019, esta vez sobre una plataforma m\xc3\xa1s aparente de nacionalismo hind\xc3\xba.\n\nEn esas elecciones, m\xc3\xa1s del 67% de los indios votaron, la mayor participaci\xc3\xb3n electoral de la historia del pa\xc3\xads.\n\nEl rival principal del BJP es el Congreso Nacional Indio, que ha gobernado el pa\xc3\xads durante gran parte de los 77 a\xc3\xb1os transcurridos desde la independencia, pero que ahora tiene baja popularidad.\n\nEn un esfuerzo por evitar otra victoria de Modi, el Congreso form\xc3\xb3 una alianza con otros l\xc3\xadderes de la oposici\xc3\xb3n, incluidos los principales partidos regionales. La Alianza Nacional para el Desarrollo Inclusivo de la India (INDIA) lanz\xc3\xb3 su campa\xc3\xb1a a finales del mes pasado con la plataforma de ""salvar la democracia"".\n\nEl v\xc3\xa1stago pol\xc3\xadtico Rahul Gandhi es la cara del partido del Congreso, pero otras figuras clave son el popular l\xc3\xadder del Partido Aam Aadmi y ministro principal de Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nTambi\xc3\xa9n hay pesos pesados regionales, como la ministra principal de Bengala Occidental y miembro del Congreso Trinamool de toda la India, Mamata Banerjee, y el ministro principal de Tamil Nadu, Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, que luchar\xc3\xa1n por impedir que el BJP se haga con el poder en sus respectivos estados, donde Modi a\xc3\xban no ha logrado abrirse paso.\n\nEl bloque INDIA se ha visto acosado por luchas internas y a\xc3\xban no ha presentado a su candidato a primer ministro. Los analistas afirman que tiene dificultades para igualar la calidad de estrella y el atractivo que proyecta Modi.\n\nLa oposici\xc3\xb3n tambi\xc3\xa9n se ve presionada por lo que considera una campa\xc3\xb1a del BJP para debilitar a los oponentes de Modi.\n\nVarios miembros destacados de la oposici\xc3\xb3n, entre ellos el ministro principal de Delhi, Kejriwal, han sido detenidos o investigados por organismos estatales en acciones que sus partidos tachan de pol\xc3\xadticas. Las autoridades fiscales federales congelaron las cuentas bancarias del Congreso y le exigieron el pago de otros US$ 218 millones en impuestos.\n\nEl BJP ha negado injerencias pol\xc3\xadticas.\n\nEntretanto, una nueva victoria de Modi consolidar\xc3\xada su posici\xc3\xb3n como uno de los l\xc3\xadderes m\xc3\xa1s importantes y longevos de la India.\n\nEl partido de Modi y sus aliados aspiran a obtener m\xc3\xa1s de 400 esca\xc3\xb1os en la Lok Sabha, lo que les dar\xc3\xada votos suficientes para cambiar la Constituci\xc3\xb3n de la naci\xc3\xb3n. Esa cifra tambi\xc3\xa9n mejorar\xc3\xa1 su mayor\xc3\xada absoluta asegurada en 2019, cuando el BJP obtuvo 303 esca\xc3\xb1os, frente a los 52 del partido del Congreso.\n\nIndia es la mayor democracia del mundo, pero tras una d\xc3\xa9cada de gobierno del BJP, los analistas afirman que el populista Modi ha estrechado el cerco sobre sus instituciones democr\xc3\xa1ticas.\n\nLas minor\xc3\xadas, especialmente los 200 millones de musulmanes del pa\xc3\xads, dicen que han sido perseguidas por las pol\xc3\xadticas nacionalistas hind\xc3\xbaes del BJP.\n\nModi ha sido acusado de silenciar a sus cr\xc3\xadticos y de reprimir a los medios de comunicaci\xc3\xb3n independientes de la India. En la Clasificaci\xc3\xb3n Mundial anual de la Libertad de Prensa, India cay\xc3\xb3 del puesto 140 en 2014 (el a\xc3\xb1o en que Modi lleg\xc3\xb3 al poder) al 161 de 180 naciones en la lista del a\xc3\xb1o pasado.\n\nDesde la demolici\xc3\xb3n de monumentos isl\xc3\xa1micos hasta el cambio de nombre de ciudades fundadas por antiguos gobernantes musulmanes y la revisi\xc3\xb3n de los libros de texto de historia, el gobierno de Modi ha supuesto un cambio s\xc3\xadsmico para la India, que ha pasado de sus valores laicos fundacionales a los de una naci\xc3\xb3n en la que prima el hinduismo. Los analistas afirman que otro mandato del BJP empujar\xc3\xa1 a la India a\xc3\xban m\xc3\xa1s por este camino.\n\nLos partidarios de Modi destacan su historial econ\xc3\xb3mico: India est\xc3\xa1 preparada para convertirse en una potencia del siglo XXI a medida que su econom\xc3\xada se expande r\xc3\xa1pidamente. Dicen que su presencia en la escena mundial, incluida la organizaci\xc3\xb3n del G20, ha consolidado al pa\xc3\xads como una potencia mundial moderna, junto con un alunizaje hist\xc3\xb3rico.\n\nModi tambi\xc3\xa9n ha cumplido muchas de sus promesas principales, siendo su mayor logro la inauguraci\xc3\xb3n del controvertido Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, un templo hind\xc3\xba en la ciudad santa de Ayodhya que se construy\xc3\xb3 en el emplazamiento de la destruida mezquita de Babri.\n\nPero, aunque la econom\xc3\xada india est\xc3\xa1 en alza, el pa\xc3\xads m\xc3\xa1s poblado del mundo no ha logrado generar suficientes puestos de trabajo para los millones de j\xc3\xb3venes que luchan por incorporarse a la poblaci\xc3\xb3n activa. El desempleo entre los j\xc3\xb3venes de 20 a 24 a\xc3\xb1os alcanzaba un impactante 44,4% a finales de 2023.\n\nEn los \xc3\xbaltimos a\xc3\xb1os, los agricultores se han convertido en la mayor amenaza para el partido gobernante, y han salido a la calle en repetidas ocasiones para exigir una mayor protecci\xc3\xb3n de su bienestar econ\xc3\xb3mico, incluidos precios fijos m\xc3\xa1s altos para sus cosechas.\n\nLa agricultura es el principal medio de subsistencia de cerca del 55% de la poblaci\xc3\xb3n india, y los agricultores ya han conseguido presionar a Modi para que derogue pol\xc3\xadticas agr\xc3\xadcolas impopulares.\n\nSe cree que las elecciones de la India son las m\xc3\xa1s caras del mundo, superando incluso a las presidenciales de Estados Unidos. En 2019, los partidos pol\xc3\xadticos, los candidatos y los organismos reguladores gastaron hasta US$ 8.600 millones, seg\xc3\xban el Centro de Estudios de los Medios de Comunicaci\xc3\xb3n, con sede en Delhi. Este a\xc3\xb1o, se espera que el gasto supere esa cifra.\n\nDesde las altas cumbres del Himalaya hasta los remotos bosques de los estados centrales de la India, los votos se emiten electr\xc3\xb3nicamente en m\xc3\xa1s de un mill\xc3\xb3n de colegios electorales. Se desplegar\xc3\xa1n unos 15 millones de trabajadores electorales, que viajar\xc3\xa1n por carretera, barco, camello, tren y helic\xc3\xb3ptero para llegar a cada votante indio.\n\nCon 4.650 metros de altitud, Tashigang, un pueblo situado en el extremo norte del estado de Himachal Pradesh, en la frontera con China, fue el colegio electoral m\xc3\xa1s alto del mundo cuando sus habitantes votaron en las elecciones al gobierno estatal de 2022.\n\nEn 2019, m\xc3\xa1s de 8.000 candidatos se presentaron a las elecciones. Este a\xc3\xb1o, todav\xc3\xada se est\xc3\xa1n anunciando los candidatos, pero m\xc3\xa1s de 2.700 partidos luchar\xc3\xa1n por los esca\xc3\xb1os de la Lok Sabha, incluidos seis partidos nacionales y m\xc3\xa1s de 70 estatales.\n\nCada partido tiene un s\xc3\xadmbolo que le asigna la Comisi\xc3\xb3n Electoral y que aparece en las papeletas, lo que ayuda a las decenas de partidos a diferenciarse, al tiempo que facilita a los votantes su elecci\xc3\xb3n en un pa\xc3\xads donde alrededor de una cuarta parte de la poblaci\xc3\xb3n es analfabeta.\n\nSon objetos cotidianos como un ventilador de techo, un peine y un mango.\n\nEl s\xc3\xadmbolo del partido gobernante, el BJP, es un loto, mientras que el del partido del Congreso es una mano alzada con las palmas abiertas. El Partido Aam Aadmi de Kejriwal (o Partido del Hombre Com\xc3\xban) es una escoba, que representa sus or\xc3\xadgenes en un movimiento callejero contra la corrupci\xc3\xb3n.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
575,575,"b'Rahul Gandhi stood in a red Jeep, amid a churning crowd in Varanasi, trying to unseat the Indian government with a microphone in his hand. ""The mic isn\'t good,"" he said. ""Please quiet down and listen."" It was the morning of Feb. 17 -- Day 35 of a journey that began in the hills of Manipur, in India\'s northeast, and would end by the ocean in Mumbai, in mid-March. In total, Gandhi would cover 15 states and 4,100 miles, traveling across a country that once voted for his party, the Indian National Congress, almost by reflex. No longer, though. For a decade, the Congress Party has been so deep in the political wilderness, occupying fewer than a tenth of the seats in Parliament, that even its well-wishers wonder if Gandhi is merely the custodian of its end.\n\nGandhi called his expedition the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra -- roughly, the Unite India March for Justice. He never said it in so many words, but the yatra was an appeal to voters to deny Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party a third straight term in parliamentary elections starting on April 19. Congress, the only other party with a national presence, is the fulcrum of an anti-B.J.P. coalition. Indian pundits and journalists bicker about many things, but on this point they\'re unanimous: Only a miracle will halt the B.J.P. Still, it falls to Gandhi, steward of his enfeebled party, to try.\n\nThe speech lasted barely 15 minutes. Gandhi is a fidgety orator, unable to shrug off the routine disturbances of a rally. He kept calling for silence, and scolding overzealous policemen regulating the mob. He didn\'t ramble, exactly, but eddied around the point he wanted to make. ""This is a country of love, not of hate,"" he said. He talked of two Indias, populated respectively by the millionaires and the impoverished. He laid into TV news channels, many of which have been captured by oligarchs prospering under the B.J.P.: ""They won\'t show the farmers, or the workers or the poor,"" he said. ""But they will show Narendra Modi 24 hours a day."" Then he helped onto his Jeep a member of the audience, a young man who complained that, despite spending hundreds of thousands of rupees on his education, he still had no job. His is a common story in Modi\'s India. Two out of every five recent college graduates are out of work, and young people make up 83 percent of the unemployed. To his crowd, Gandhi called out: ""These are the two issues facing India: unemployment and -- ?"" He received only a tepid response of ""poverty."" When he finished, there was no applause.\n\nThe crush of people at the rally was suffocating, although in India a crowd is no index of popularity. People may gawk and then go vote for the other guy -- and Gandhi is, after all, one of the country\'s most recognizable men. Officially, he is no longer his party\'s president, but he is undoubtedly its face. At 53, with a well-salted beard and serious eyes, he\'s too old to be called Congress\'s ""scion,"" but he still wears the sheen of dynasty. His great-grandfather, the unflinchingly secular Jawaharlal Nehru, was India\'s first prime minister. His grandmother, Indira, and his father, Rajiv, both became prime ministers; both were assassinated. His mother, Sonia, steered Congress into government in 2004 and 2009, but declined the top post. Then, on the heels of several corruption scandals, the mighty party -- 140 years old next year -- came unstuck. Out of 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament, Congress holds just 46, compared to the B.J.P.\'s 288. Gandhi embodies all this history: the triumphs as well as the failures. For the crowds, that is the fascination he exerts.\n\nOne of Modi\'s successes has been not just to trounce the Congress Party but also to persuade people that the party has weakened India and emasculated its Hindus. Through his cult of personality, Modi is fulfilling a century-old project, recasting India as a Hindu nation, in which minorities, particularly Muslims, live at the sufferance of the majority. Emblematic of this is a new law offering fast-tracked citizenship to people fleeing Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan -- as long as they aren\'t Muslim. It is the B.J.P.\'s totemic achievement: the use of religion to decide who can be called ""Indian."" Opposing this law or indeed resisting the B.J.P. in any way has proved difficult. Investigating agencies mount flimsy cases against critics of the government, as Amnesty International has frequently noted. (Amnesty itself halted its work in India in 2020, in the midst of what it later called an ""incessant witch hunt"" by the government.) Activists are regularly imprisoned, sometimes on the basis of planted evidence; journalists are sent to jail or otherwise bullied so frequently that India has slipped to 161st out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, just three spots above Russia. Pliant courts often endorse it all. Such is the mood in India that one of the plainest sentences in Congress\'s election manifesto is also one of its most resonant: ""We promise you freedom from fear.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
576,576,"b""Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party has never had the support of most voters. But his rivals are too fractured and dysfunctional to capitalize on that.\n\nThe last time Indians voted in a national election, in 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, won running away. But even then, more than 60 percent of voters cast ballots for other parties.\n\nThat Mr. Modi has established such dominance in Parliament despite falling well short of majority popular support is a reflection of a dysfunctional and fractured political opposition.\n\nThe main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, governed for decades after the country's independence in 1947, guided by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The party's standing is now much reduced: In 2019, it won 52 seats in Parliament to the B.J.P.'s 303. It is not expected to do much better in this year's election, which began on Friday and runs for six weeks.\n\nHere's why India's political opposition is in such dire straits.\n\nThe Congress is a shell of what it once was.\n\nThe Congress, long positioned at India's political center, has struggled to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the Hindu nationalist B.J.P. That has held back the broader opposition's fight against Mr. Modi.\n\nThe Congress has faced a leadership crisis, a series of rebellions and bouts of infighting. Even after two consecutive losses to Mr. Modi, the party has stuck to its dynastic leadership. It has again put forward Rahul Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Indian prime ministers, as its face in taking on Mr. Modi.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
577,577,"b'But in March he joined several of his senior party leaders when he was arrested. He\'s denied corruption charges and accuses the government of being vindictive. Supporters fear his arrest will dent the AAP\'s election campaign.\n\nWhat will decide how Indians vote? Will a grand new Hindu temple prove Mr Modi\'s trump card? Will the economy, job prospects or welfare schemes be uppermost in voters\' minds? Or will they vote on the basis of caste or religion?\n\nThe temple to Hindu God Ram in the northern city of Ayodhya is expected to provide a divine push to Mr Modi\'s election pitch by appealing to the majority Hindu community.\n\nThe temple - which replaced a 16 Century mosque torn down by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots in which nearly 2,000 people died, was inaugurated with much fanfare by the PM in January.\n\nThe event was broadcast live on TV; schools, colleges and most offices were given a day off and people were encouraged to watch the ceremony.\n\nCould PM Modi\'s vow to make India ""a developed nation by 2047"", its independence centenary, chime with voters?\n\nIndia - with its GDP at $3.7tn (\xc2\xa33bn) - is the world\'s fastest growing major economy. Last year, it beat the UK to become the fifth largest in the world and is on course to reach $7tn by 2027, which would see it leapfrog Japan and Germany into third spot after the US and China.\n\nBut the spoils of India\'s boom are concentrated in few hands and inequality remains high. India ranks 140th in terms of global per-capita income and more than 34 million of its citizens live on less than $2.15 a day, even though government data shows ""extreme poverty"" has reduced a lot.\n\nMany voters will be thinking of jobs. Seven to eight million young Indians enter the labour market annually, but millions are unable to find work.\n\nRecent government data shows falling unemployment and a steady increase in labour force participation - to 57.9% in 2022-23 from 49.8% five years earlier. But experts point out most new jobs are low-paying and poor quality - for example in agriculture or women doing unpaid family work.\n\nA telling indication of distress is that millions more are now signing up for the $3-a-day government rural job scheme. Thousands are even ready to migrate to war zones for work.\n\nThey were meant to clean up murky political financing, but electoral bonds were recently banned by India\'s top court, which ruled them ""unconstitutional"". The court also ordered the government-run State Bank of India (SBI) to provide details of who bought them and how much parties received.\n\nThe fact that the BJP was the biggest beneficiary - securing almost half of bonds worth 120bn rupees ($1.4bn; \xc2\xa31.1bn) donated between 2018 and 2024 - isn\'t looking good on Mr Modi\'s report card.\n\nReports have linked many donations to companies being investigated by government anti-crime agencies. Calling it the ""biggest scam in Indian history"", opposition parties allege the agencies were used for ""extortion"", which ministers have denied.\n\nThe scale of India\'s welfare state is staggering: the Modi government claims it has spent hundreds of billions of dollars to help poor households, reaching more than 900 million people. A number of state leaders have also invested heavily in welfare schemes.\n\nBut does that free sack of rice or money to build toilets prompt people to vote for a party? Analysts say such schemes can help, but that they are unlikely to be the only driving factor.\n\nIndia has long had religious divisions but critics say fault lines have deepened in the decade since the BJP won power. They say India is becoming a Hindu state where its secular status is increasingly being challenged and its 200 million Muslims - the country\'s biggest minority, accounting for some 14% of the population - are marginalised. The government rejects this, saying it is inclusive.\n\nIn the last Lok Sabha, the BJP did not have a single Muslim MP. Rights groups and activists also point to increasing violence against Muslims, especially in states governed by the BJP. The government denies accusations it has a divisive agenda and its supporters appear largely unconcerned by such criticisms.\n\nThe election comes amid accusations from the opposition, activists and global rights organisations that Indian democracy is under threat. Rahul Gandhi has accused the government of targeting opposition leaders, spying upon them and imposing constraints on parliament, the judiciary and the free press.\n\nOrganisations like Human Rights Watch say the Indian authorities have used politically motivated criminal charges, including terrorism, to jail many critics and foreign funding rules to harass the opposition, rights groups and the press - charges the government denies.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Congress' loyalist KL Sharma will be contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Amethi, the seat Rahul Gandhi lost in the 2019 general elections to BJP leader Smriti Irani.\n\nFriday was the last date for filing nominations for the seats that will go to polls on May 20 in the fifth round of the seven-phase general elections.\n\nAlso Read: Rahul Gandhi ditches contest against Smriti Irani, to file nomination from Rae Bareli; Congress fields KL Sharma from Amethi\n\nRae Bareli, the constituency was held by Sonia Gandhi who became a member of the Rajya Sabha.\n\nThe party has secured victory in the Congress stronghold in almost every Lok Sabha election since 1951. Prior to Sonia Gandhi, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had been victorious in Rae Bareli on three occasions.\n\nThe constituency also chose Indira's husband and Congress leader Feroze Gandhi as its representative twice, in 1952 and 1957. Only twice has a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family refrained from contesting the seat, in 1962 and 1999.\n\nAlso Read: Rahul Gandhi has forgotten his own slogan 'Daro Mat': BJP slams Nehru-Gandhi scion for ditching Amethi\n\nBoth constituencies have been long-standing strongholds of the Gandhi-Nehru family, with family members representing these seats for many years.\n\nThe Congress, participating in 17 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh through a seat-sharing agreement with the Samajwadi Party (SP), has declared candidates for all the seats.\n\nAmethi is set to vote in the fifth phase on May 20, with the deadline for filing nominations set for May 3. Rahul's loss in Amethi, previously regarded as a stronghold for the Congress, to Smriti Irani in the 2019 elections was viewed as a major setback to the party's national reputation.\n\nAlso Read: Why Congress chose Rae Bareli for Rahul Gandhi\n\nRahul served as the representative of Amethi in the Lok Sabha from 2004 to 2019. His father, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was also a member of the Lower House representing Amethi from 1981 until his passing in 1991.\n\nSonia Gandhi ran for elections from this constituency in 1999 before handing over the responsibility to Rahul in 2004.\n\nCurrently, Rahul represents Wayanad in the Lok Sabha while Irani is seeking reelection in Amethi.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PM Modi used Pitroda\'s statement to criticize the opposition party, stating that their mantra is to ""loot"" people both during and after their lifetimes.\n\nHere are seven instances where Pitroda\'s remarks created political turmoil:\n\nThe Congress party clarified its stance, stating that sensationalizing Pitroda\'s remarks was an attempt to divert attention from PM Modi\'s ""malicious"" poll campaign. Pitroda also clarified that his comments on the US inheritance tax were taken out of context and had no bearing on any party\'s policy, including the Congress.\n\nPitroda\'s statements have sparked a political row, with BJP leaders slamming him over his remarks on wealth redistribution. The Congress party distanced itself from his comments, emphasizing that his views do not always reflect the party\'s position. Inheritance tax refers to a state levy on assets received as part of an inheritance, a concept that has stirred debate in India\'s political landscape.\n\nPitroda\'s controversial remarks in various contexts have often landed the Congress party in challenging situations. His comments on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Pulwama attack, Ram Mandir, and the drafting of the constitution have stirred political debates, reflecting the complexities of India\'s diverse political discourse.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
604,604,"b'Famous economist-cum-journalist Swaminathan Aiyar has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be back to power no matter even if the party loses as many as 100 seats. Speaking to ET Now Swaminathan said that he has no doubt that people will opt for Modi, irrespective of their reservations and worries like unemployment and higher inflation.\n\nExplaining his assertion, Swaminathan said that people are likely to pick Modi if the choice is between Modi and Rahul Gandhi. Modi is Koh-i-Noor for BJP and the party is going to win the elections on his popularity alone, he said. ""As far as the BJP is concerned, there is no other jewel to compare to Modi. If the stark choice is, do you want Mr Narendra Modi or do you want Mr Rahul Gandhi? I have no doubt that people will opt for Modi, whatever their other reservations,"" Swami said.\n\nSwami also said that he has not seen any election that is so uninteresting. ""I have been in journalism for more than 60 years and in the vast majority of elections, the two main issues are employment and inflation. Once in a while, you get an anti-corruption wave. There is no such wave right now. In fact, this is the most uninteresting, unexciting election we can imagine for a very long time. There is no josh in it, no vigour and certainly on the economic side you cannot say there is any vim and vigour,"" he said.\n\nHe feels that even with the most unexciting elections, Modi will be back in power. ""Now, whether he will get an increased majority or a reduced majority, that is another matter. But even if the BJP loses as much as 100 seats, they will surely get more parties with them and so surely Modi will be back,"" he said.\n\nHe said unemployment among the educated is the biggest issue in India due to the \'pathetic education system\' in India and it can\'t be solved until we overhaul the entire education system and that cannot be done in one year, five years or ten years. ""This is a long-term problem and a lot of it has to come from the state governments which are in charge of education at the school level. So, unemployment remains a problem, especially among the educated unemployed,"" he highlighted.\n\nSwami also highlighted that the unemployment problem in India is also because we missed the labour-intensive employment in the Nehru-Indira days. ""How do you get away from this fundamental problem? We have a situation where we missed the bus on labour-intensive employment in the Nehru-Indira days. So, having missed that bus, we are trying to get back on that bus. We cannot get back on that bus, that bus has left. For the low-wage items, the benefit right now has gone to Bangladesh, Laos, Vietnam, and it will soon go to Africa, where the wages are much lower. I visited Ethiopia. Indians had set up factories there. One businessman said that the wages in Ethiopia are only 20% of Indian wages,"" he said. ""Many of the labour-intensive things, no matter what kind of subsidy or PLI you give, are going to move on. I am not saying that the Congress Party or Mamata or anybody else can solve this particular problem easily, but the whole educational system must be overhauled,"" he added.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

607,607,"b""One of the worst ideas of Congress has been abolition of the National Pension System (NPS) and return to the old pension scheme (OPS) in the three states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Himachal Pradesh, where it came to power. Its newer state government in Karnataka is considering the same step, but has yet to take it. Is better sense prevailing?\n\nThe new Congress election manifesto makes no mention of OPS. Answering questions, P Chidambaram said OPS was very much on the party's mind, but it was waiting to react to the report of an official committee on the issue. Does that suggest second thoughts?\n\nIn Jharkhand, the coalition government of which Congress is a part has gone back to OPS. Seeing the populist trend, even some BJP leaders in other states have said OPS needs reconsideration. Sorry, it doesn't.\n\nA recent RBI study found that a shift to OPS from 2023 onward would provide a small, temporary relief to state governments. But the additional pension burden would soon mount and eventually cost a spectacular 450% of the NPS burden. There cannot be a stronger indictment of such a short-sighted policy.\n\nReversion of Congress to OPS was denounced in 2022 by none other than Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the party's former deputy chairman of Planning Commission. He declared, 'Bringing back the old pension scheme is one of the biggest 'revdis' (populist giveaways) that are now being invented.'\n\nManmohan Singh, Congress PM from 2004 to 2014, had also castigated OPS as a fiscal millstone. During his term, he had ushered in NPS, and boasted about it as a major fiscal reform whose wisdom would be recognised by future generations.\n\nSo, two of the greatest economists ever to grace Congress had denounced OPS and hailed NPS as a great reform. Did any economic study persuade Rahul and Sonia Gandhi otherwise? No, their move to reinstate OPS was a desperate search for new freebies to win votes and seem different from BJP.\n\nUnder OPS, central and state government employees got a fixed pension of 50% of last-drawn basic pay, indexed to inflation. Globally, such a 'defined pension' turned out to be a fiscal burden that pre-empted a rising share of government revenues at the expense of other urgent needs. So, countries' abandonment of economic sense across the globe shifted to a pension based on 'defined contributions'.\n\nNPS aimed to do the same. It applied to those joining government service from the start of 2004. Their defined contribution was 10% of basic salary and dearness allowance (DA), with a matching government contribution (later raised to 14%). By investing part of this contribution in stock markets, NPS aimed to ensure a good pension for retiring employees, even while reducing the budgetary burden.\n\nBut government employees always resented the deduction of 10% of salary towards NPS. They wanted a return to OPS under which they made no contribution at all. They sought to benefit at the cost of posterity. Their attitude was that of Groucho Marx who famously said, 'Why should I worry about posterity? What did posterity ever do for me?'\n\nIn 1990-91, the Centre's pension bill was \xe2\x82\xb93,272 cr, and the states' bill was \xe2\x82\xb93,131 cr. By 2020-21, the Centre's bill had jumped 58 times to \xe2\x82\xb91,90,886 cr, and the states' bill 125 times to \xe2\x82\xb93,86,001 cr. NPS aimed to end this march towards fiscal suicide.\n\nIn technical parlance, OPS was unfunded. No corpus of funds was created to ensure a stream of income that would suffice to pay future pensions. OPS was a 'pay as you go' system where current taxpayers would continually finance the pensions of retirees.\n\nThis system was sustainable as long as there were plenty of youngsters to replace retiring pensioners. But the world over, fertility rates have fallen below replacement rate. And, so, future generations will be fewer in number than those retiring. In such circumstances, defined pensions will place an intolerable burden on young taxpayers. In some cases, the pension bill will exceed the government's entire salary bill.\n\nSo, countries across the globe have been shifting from a defined pension to a defined pension contribution into a fund. This fund is invested in government bonds and equities to generate a stream of income that finances future pensions. That is the aim of NPS. It ensures that rising pensions will not create intolerable fiscal burdens in the long run.\n\nAlas, Rahul Gandhi jumped on to the bandwagon of government employees to gain votes. This was short-term opportunism and absence of serious thinking.\n\nDid the return to OPS, effectively a freebie to government employees, ensure victory for Congress in the state elections in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in December 2023? No. The party was thrashed in both states. It was one more demonstration of the electoral lesson that while competition in freebies may be part of electoral politics, they are no substitutes for innovative ideas and performance. Congress needs to absorb that lesson.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attacking the Congress, Modi had said that its manifesto carried an imprint of the Muslim League. The prime minister has also repeatedly slammed the opposition party over Congress leader Sam Pitroda\'s \'inheritance tax\' comments amid the row on the issue of \'wealth redistribution\'.\n\n""I do not think he (PM Modi) has read the manifesto. It never says anything that the prime minister and his party are claiming. Please, for God\'s sake, I beg of them, read the manifesto.

India is a free country and Indians are a free people. They do not go by what others say, whether it is America, Russia or Pakistan. We decide on our own,"" he added.\n\nIn response to another question, Farooq Abdullah said, ""The Sangh Parivar has never been part of the freedom struggle. This is not as if I am saying it today. This has been said in Parliament. They sided with the British when people were fighting for Independence. It is on record, not Farooq Abdullah saying on his own.""\n\nAbdullah admitted that the INDIA bloc was facing problems in the Ladakh Lok Sabha seat but made it clear that the National Conference would support the official candidate of the opposition alliance.\n\n""We are facing a problem in Ladakh.

He said, ""Congress should either withdraw it from their manifesto or accept that it is indeed their intention...I want people to take Sam Pitroda\'s statement seriously. Their intention is now in the open, its cognisance should be taken by people...""\n\nEarlier, emphasising the need for policy toward wealth redistribution, Pitroda spoke about on the concept of inheritance tax prevailing in America and said these are issued that will need to be discussed.\n\n""In America, there is an inheritance tax. If one has 100 million USD worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer 45% to his children, 55% is grabbed by the government. That\'s an interesting law. It says you in your generation, made wealth and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair,"" Pitroda had said.\n\nAfter the comments snowballed into a controversy Pitroda sought to downplay the issue saying he had only cited inheritance tax in the US as an example.\n\n""Who said 55% will be taken away? Who said something like this should be done in India? Why is BJP and media in panic? I mentioned US inheritance tax in the US only as an example in my normal conversation on TV. Can I not mention facts? I said these are the kind of issues people will have to discuss and debate.

He underscored the strategic importance of regions like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh in shaping electoral outcomes.\n\nCommenting on Rahul Gandhi\'s reported reluctance to contest from Amethi, Kishor stressed the significance of winning key states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh for the opposition\'s national prospects.\n\nReflecting on the BJP\'s trajectory, Kishor cautioned against complacency, drawing parallels with the Congress\'s decline following its landmark victory in 1984. He emphasized the need for opposition parties to seize opportunities when the ruling party faces setbacks, citing instances where the BJP\'s electoral fortunes faltered but were not capitalized upon by the opposition.\n\nLooking ahead, Kishor pondered the implications of another significant mandate for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, particularly concerning the prospect of ""big decisions"" on the horizon.

The world\'s fifth-largest economy has grown fast in the past few years and Modi has ""guaranteed"" to take it to the third position if he wins the election.\n\nThe BJP draws its support mainly from Hindus, who form 80% of the country\'s 1.42 billion people and for whom Modi earlier this year delivered on a key party promise of building a grand Hindu temple on a disputed site.\n\nThe opposition ""INDIA"" alliance, largely a centre-left grouping of more than two dozen disparate parties, says a victory for it is essential to save the country\'s democratic and secular setup, lift its marginalised communities, raise prices for farmers and create jobs for its young. Opinion polls, which have a mixed record in India, predict another thrashing of the Congress alliance at the hands of the BJP.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
